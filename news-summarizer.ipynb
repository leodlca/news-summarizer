      "A Policeman’s Bear Hug Stops a Suicide Bomber From Killing More - The New York Times\n",
      "\n",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan — No one will ever know what went through the mind of Afghan Police Lt. Sayed Basam Pacha in those moments when he came face to face with a man he suspected of being a suicide bomber on Thursday afternoon, but whatever it was, he did not hesitate to act. At his back was a crowd of civilians, many of them dignitaries, leaving the hall he was guarding. Around him were officers from the police company he commanded. The suspect had just approached their heavily guarded gate, the only way in or out of the compound around the hall. Broad-shouldered and heavily muscled, Lieutenant Pacha shouted at the suspect to halt, but instead the man started running. The officer stopped him, throwing his arms around him in a bear hug. A second later the bomber detonated the explosive vest hidden under his coat. Fourteen people, including Lieutenant Pacha and seven other police officers as well as six civilians, were killed 18 others were wounded, seven police and 11 civilians, said Basir Mujahed, a police spokesman. There was little doubt the death toll would have been far higher without the lieutenant’s body blunting the blast, Mr. Mujahed said. “He’s a hero, he saved many lives,” he said. “All seven of those policemen are heroes but especially him. Just think if that suicide attacker got past the gate, what would have happened — you cannot even imagine.” Lieutenant Pacha’s father, Gen. Sayed Nizam Agha, is also a police commander. “My son sacrificed himself to save other people,” General Agha said, proud but tearful when reached by telephone. He wept as he recounted his son’s story. “He had two bachelor degrees, one in political science and another one at the police academy,” the father said. “He studied five years in Turkey. He came back from Turkey a year and a half ago. He was 25 years old and he was single. He has three brothers and one sister. He and I are the only police in our family. He was a very sporty guy.” Weight lifting was his sport, his friends said. The general apologized and said he could not keep talking any longer he was too overcome with emotion. He had one last thing to say though. “I lost my bodyguard in this incident as well,” the general said. He had assigned the bodyguard to assist his son at the event, which many high-profile political figures were attending. “He was my bodyguard for the last 15 years, he was like my son,” General Agha said. “His name was Noor Agha, he left three children behind.” Two journalists for Rah-e-Farda Radio and Television were also caught up in the attack, said an anchorman at the station, Ramazan Abdullahzada. A reporter, Taqi Sadid, was in critical condition and a cameraman, Hussain Nazari, was missing, he said. “We checked all the private hospitals and public hospitals, but couldn’t find him,” Mr. Abdullahzada said. “Now we are in front of the police hospital. I hope he will be here.” Although only on police duty in Kabul for a year and a half, Lieutenant Pacha had already received a commendation from his superiors, which he displayed proudly on his Facebook page. His current post was commander of the Second Company, Police District 4 in Kabul, which includes the Khairkhana area where the attack took place. The lieutenant never expected to die, friends said, although the profession of Afghan police officer has become increasingly perilous. Dozens of officers were killed in five Taliban attacks Monday and Tuesday. “He was always worried about victims, but he never thought that one day he would get killed,” said his longtime friend, Sayed Najib Asil, a producer at Tolo Television. If the lieutenant had a chance in the final moments of his life to look back on it, Mr. Asil said what would have stood out was his passion for higher education — he wanted to continue advanced studies in Britain — and his determination to stay in Afghanistan long-term. “He wanted to make changes here, he had an opportunity to leave and go live abroad, but he rejected it,” Mr. Asil said. “He really hated corruption, and felt bad when people assumed that all policemen are corrupt.” Lieutenant Pacha was not someone who would have faced death fatalistically, as his friends told it. “He had very big dreams for himself,” Mr. Asil said. “He wanted to be a general like his father, and maybe one day a high ministry official.” The characteristic his friends most noted, though, was his cheerfulness. Every week or two he and his friends had a party together. “He was always the cheeriest guy in the party, making everyone else happy,” Mr. Asil said. The Islamic State in Afghanistan claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a post on Twitter by the Terror Monitor organization. It was the latest in a series of suicide attacks by the group in Kabul. A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, said his group did not carry it out. If Lieutenant Pacha had been less conscientious, he might have missed the attack altogether. The hall had been rented for a political meeting by supporters of Atta Muhammad Noor, the governor of the northern Balkh Province, said Tahir Qadiry, an aide to the governor. Governor Noor has been in a protracted dispute with the government of President Ashraf Ghani. During the long afternoon event, Lieutenant Pacha had gone into the hall to drink tea with some of the guests, but then said he wanted to return to the gate as people started to leave, a witness said. The owner of the hall told him to finish his tea, but he said he had to check on his men, according to the witness. Lieutenant Pacha returned just as the suicide bomber arrived people saw him challenge and then bear hug the attacker. Mr. Asil said his friend’s split-second decision was to be expected. “I wasn’t surprised when I heard he had hugged the suicide attacker,” he said. “He was a very brave guy.”\n"

      "\n",
      "This article is a collaboration between The Times and ProPublica, the independent nonprofit investigative-journalism organization. Express Scripts claims it is owed more than $14.5 million in fees and rebates related to Evzio, and it has dropped the drug from its preferred list. In January 2016, Evzio carried a list price of $937.50 for two injectors, and Express Scripts billed Kaléo for about $25,000 in administrative fees for its commercial clients for that month. This is not the first time Express Scripts has sued a drug maker with expensive products. In 2015, Express Scripts filed suit against Horizon Pharma, also over unpaid fees. Express Scripts is also being sued.\n",
      "\n",
      "This article is a collaboration between The Times and ProPublica, the independent nonprofit investigative-journalism organization. A company that manages prescription drug plans for tens of millions of Americans has sued a tiny drug maker that makes an emergency treatment for heroin and painkiller overdoses, increasing the tension between the companies that make drugs and those that decide whether they should be covered. Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefits manager, is suing Kaléo, the manufacturer of Evzio, the injectable overdose treatment whose price quintupled last year, drawing widespread outrage and inquiries from members of Congress. Express Scripts claims it is owed more than $14.5 million in fees and rebates related to Evzio, and it has dropped the drug from its preferred list. In recent months, anger over rising drug costs set off a civil war within the pharmaceutical industry, pitting drug makers against other players in the health care system, including the little-known pharmacy benefit managers that negotiate with drug makers on behalf of insurers, large employers and government health programs. Drug makers and some members of Congress have accused Express Scripts and other benefit managers of operating in the shadows, pocketing an undisclosed share of the payments they exact from drug makers even as consumers are asked to pay inflated prices for the medicines they need. The lawsuit was heavily redacted because Express Scripts said it contained “sensitive business information,” but nevertheless it provides some tantalizing details about the company’s dealings. Consultants and brokers — who advise employers on their prescription drug plans — said it showed that Express Scripts is collecting fees that keep rising as drug prices go up. For example, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in St. Louis, Express Scripts charged Kaléo “administrative fees” that climbed sharply at the same time that Evzio was rising in price. In January 2016, Evzio carried a list price of $937.50 for two injectors, and Express Scripts billed Kaléo for about $25,000 in administrative fees for its commercial clients for that month. But three months later, in April, Evzio’s price had climbed to $4,687.50, and these fees totaled nearly $130,000. That’s on top of charges that included “formulary rebates,” or drug discounts, and “price protection rebates,” which are triggered when a drug jumps in price. Those price-protection rebates totaled $14 million — most of the money that Express Scripts is trying to recoup. Benefit managers like Express Scripts typically pass the rebates they collect from manufacturers along to their clients — insurers and large employers — after taking a portion of the rebates for themselves. But critics, like Linda Cahn, the chief executive of Pharmacy Benefit Consultants in Morristown, N.J., say that the benefit managers are not transparent about what share of fees they keep, and what share they pass along to clients. Administrative fees are particularly murky, she and others said. Some of the fees are passed to clients, but benefit managers also collect other fees that are not returned to clients. “The lawsuit reveals that Express Scripts is collecting immense sums of money. No one knows what they’re passing through and what they’re retaining,” said Ms. Cahn, who flagged the lawsuit in a note to clients Monday. “Every client and the federal government and taxpayers should insist that they do.” But Brian Henry, a spokesman for Express Scripts, disagreed with her assessment and described Kaléo as a “deadbeat dad.” “They owe rebates and administrative fees that we share with our clients and we are working to get that money back,” he said in a statement. Mr. Henry also said, “The vast majority of the administrative fees are passed back to our clients.” In cases in which they are not, he said, it is with the consent of the client. While Mr. Henry initially said that all administrative fees are passed along to Medicare plans, he later said he misspoke and that he should have said the “vast majority” of such fees were passed along to Medicare plans. Spencer Williamson, the chief executive of Kaléo, said in a statement that the lawsuit was “baseless” and that the company was committed to providing affordable access to its drug “without burdensome paperwork or high out-of-pocket costs.” The lawsuit is the latest piece of bad news for Kaléo, a private Virginia company with just two products on the market. When Evzio arrived on the market in 2014, it was sold as an easy-to-use device, similar to an EpiPen, that could be stowed in a pocket or medicine cabinet and quickly used by friends or relatives to reverse the effects of a drug overdose. But while the device was initially hailed by addiction experts who said it would make it easier to stop fatal overdoses, the company came under heavy criticism in 2016, when it quintupled the price of Evzio. The price increase — which came in the midst of a national opioid abuse epidemic — prompted letters from members of Congress, demanding to know what had prompted the change. Kaléo has said it sharply raised the price of Evzio to cover the cost of a new patient-assistance program that lowers the out-of-pocket costs for people who cannot afford the product. Kaléo covers all of the out-of-pocket costs for patients with private insurance, and offers Evzio free of charge to uninsured people who make less than $100,000 a year. But critics have said that such patient-assistance programs serve to drive up the cost of drugs to the health care system because while they ease the burden on patients, they leave insurers with the bulk of the bill, especially when a less expensive alternative is available. Other forms of naloxone, the active ingredient in Evzio, are available at a much lower price. This is not the first time Express Scripts has sued a drug maker with expensive products. In 2015, Express Scripts filed suit against Horizon Pharma, also over unpaid fees. Horizon agreed to pay Express Scripts $65 million in September 2016 to settle the case. After initially dropping coverage of Horizon’s drugs, Express Scripts added them back to its preferred drug list. Express Scripts is also being sued. Last year, the insurance giant Anthem sued Express Scripts in federal court in New York for $15 billion and claimed the company had been overcharging it for drugs. Express Scripts, which denied the claims, said recently that it would most likely lose Anthem, its largest customer, beginning in 2020, leading to speculation about how the company will replace the business it is losing.\n",

      "NAIROBI, Kenya — War and a collapsing economy have set off a famine in South Sudan, the United Nations announced on Monday, and millions of people are in urgent need of food. An ethnic conflict erupted three years ago in South Sudan, killing tens of thousands, driving millions from their homes and hindering delivery of lifesaving aid. Malnutrition rates have soared above emergency levels, and countless people have died of hunger, United Nations officials said. “Our worst fears have been realized,” said Serge Tissot of the Food and Agriculture Organization, part of the United Nations. So far, the famine has affected a relatively small area in the northern part of the country, where the conflict between the government and rebel groups has been most intense. Thousands of people in that area have fled their homes, and many are living deep in the swamps or sweltering bush and surviving off wild plants and filthy water. Battles are still raging in many parts of South Sudan, and United Nations officials fear the famine could soon spread. “Over a quarter of a million children are already severely malnourished,” said Jeremy Hopkins, a Unicef official in South Sudan. “If we do not reach these children with urgent aid, many of them will die.” South Sudan constitutes one of the biggest emergencies in Africa, perhaps the largest. The country broke off from Sudan in 2011 after decades of guerrilla warfare. After two years of peace, South Sudan cracked open in internecine conflict that pitted armed men from the largest ethnic groups against each other. Each side fields tens of thousands of battle-hardened soldiers who often target civilians. African Union investigators have detailed accounts of massacres, mass rapes and forced cannibalism. In recent months, Western officials have voiced fears of genocide. Other nations have struggled with how to help, and several rounds of peace talks have failed. The United Nations has more than 10,000 peacekeepers in South Sudan, which is relatively few for a rugged country nearly the size of Texas, that is crawling with armed groups that keep splintering. The United Nations considers famine a technical term, and for one to be declared, malnutrition and death rates have to exceed certain thresholds. One of the gravest problems in South Sudan is access for aid groups. Both the government and the rebels have attacked humanitarian convoys and warehouses, making it difficult to deliver aid to the hardest-hit areas. Aid officials are urging the armed groups to allow emergency supplies to pass through their areas. Another worry is the prediction of drought. Meteorologists have said that this year is going to be especially hot and dry across much of eastern Africa. “The entire humanitarian community have been trying with all our might to avoid this catastrophe,” said Joyce Luma, the South Sudan director of the World Food Program. But, she warned, “there is only so much that humanitarian assistance can achieve in the absence of meaningful peace and security.”\n",

      "All his life, Bob Weinstein toiled in the shadow of his larger-than-life older sibling, Harvey Weinstein.

Bob Weinstein, who owns about 20 percent of the Weinstein Company, declined requests for an interview.

But Mr. Fields, Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, dismissed that notion.\n",
      "\n",
      "All his life, Bob Weinstein toiled in the shadow of his larger-than-life older sibling, Harvey Weinstein. Coming across more like an introverted accountant than a Hollywood movie mogul, Bob Weinstein has publicly insisted over the years that he never wanted the attention, and did not mind being the lesser-known brother even though he was a co-founder of Miramax and the Weinstein Company and shepherded smash hits like “Scream” and “Scary Movie.” He once joked that there was not “physically room” in the spotlight for both Weinsteins anyway. Bob Weinstein, 63, is now scrambling to save the Weinstein Company, which is a shambles amid allegations of sexual harassment and rape against Harvey Weinstein going back decades. With his brother fired and creative partners fleeing, Bob Weinstein first tried to prevent a sale, publicly insisting that “business is continuing as usual” and telling agents and filmmakers about ideas to rename the studio and bring women onto its board. In recent days, the plan shifted, with the investment firm Colony Capital negotiating to buy some or all of the studio. The Weinstein Company and Colony agreed on a limited window to make a deal. If no agreement is reached and no deal with another buyer materializes, bankruptcy and liquidation could loom. “He’s working very hard to hold the company together, stabilize the company, protect the employees, protect his shareholders,” David Boies, a lawyer who represents the studio, said of Mr. Weinstein. Yet Colony sees no future for Bob Weinstein at the company, should it emerge from this crisis, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were private. Last weekend, Bob Weinstein told The Hollywood Reporter that his brother was “sick and depraved.” He also said that, until The New York Times, The New Yorker and others revealed sexual harassment and rape allegations against his brother, he thought his sibling’s “philandering” with women involved “all consensual situations.” But Kathy DeClesis, Bob Weinstein’s former assistant, said she confronted him about his brother’s behavior over a quarter-century ago. She was concerned about a young woman she supervised at Miramax, the film studio that the brothers started in the late 1970s. The woman had left the company after an encounter with Harvey Weinstein — fleeing so quickly that she never claimed the extra shoes under her desk, another former employee recalled. Ms. DeClesis said she later handed Bob Weinstein a letter from a lawyer representing the young woman, who eventually received a settlement. “Your brother is a pig,” Ms. DeClesis remembers telling Bob Weinstein around the same time. She said she quit shortly afterward. Bob Weinstein, who owns about 20 percent of the Weinstein Company, declined requests for an interview. His lawyer, Bert Fields, said, “Bob has no recollection of that happening.” A few years ago, the TV writer Marti Noxon, an executive producer of shows like “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” said that Bob Weinstein tried to persuade her to take on projects including a horror movie, and a remake of a robot film. Ms. Noxon said she was not interested, but he badgered her on the phone and grew belligerent when she would not agree, telling her she was hurting her career. Ms. Noxon says she asked him why he was speaking to her that way. “I don’t know if I really want to work with you, or if you’re just the girl who won’t” have sex with me, he said, using a vulgar term, according to Ms. Noxon. Mr. Fields, Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, said there was “nothing belligerent or pressuring in his conversations” with Ms. Noxon, “and it sure as hell had nothing to do with sex.” People who have worked for Bob Weinstein, a twice-divorced father of four and avid New York Jets fan, describe him as a number cruncher. He focused on projects with more commercial potential than his older brother, overseeing films like “Spy Kids” and “Bad Santa” through the company’s Dimension Films label. Though known to have a volcanic temper, he also fostered loyalty among a small group of staff members and has a reputation as a homebody. Pantea Ghaderi, a spokeswoman for Dimension, said she and others at the company were “shocked and sickened” to read the accusations against Harvey Weinstein. “I have been lucky enough to get to know Bob closely for years now,” Ms. Ghaderi, who has reported to Bob Weinstein for nearly a decade, said in an email. “He has always shown me the utmost respect as a boss, mentor and friend.” But one woman, a television writer named Amanda Segel, came forward this week to claim that Bob Weinstein harassed her. Last summer, as Ms. Segel was working as an executive producer of “The Mist,” a Weinstein Company series, he asked her to dinner at Dan Tana’s in West Hollywood. Ms. Segal said he asked her to sit closer in the booth and dropped hints that he would like to date her. At the end of the night he said, “I’m a hugger,” and embraced her, Ms. Segel recalled in a phone interview. (Variety first reported her harassment allegation.) More invitations followed. In a July 2016 email reviewed by The Times, Ms. Segel told the creator of “The Mist,” Christian Torpe, that she found Bob Weinstein’s attention “super creepy.” Mr. Torpe responded, “That is not O.K., in any way.” A few weeks later, Ms. Segel said she told colleagues that she was being sexually harassed and asked her lawyer to complain to the Weinstein Company. The contact stopped. Mr. Fields said that Ms. Segel’s account was “riddled with false and misleading assertions.” He added, “There’s no way any fair-minded person could label this — even if you were to believe it — as sexual harassment.” In emails between Bob Weinstein and Ms. Segel that were shared with The Times by Mr. Fields, the two seem to have a friendly rapport. “Last night was delightful,” Ms. Segel wrote in one. But there was also some awkwardness. In making one of his dinner invitations, Bob Weinstein wrote, “If u can’t do that, then your fired!!! Oh I forgot, we are supposed to be friends. Ha!” (Mr. Fields said that Mr. Weinstein was joking and that Ms. Segel appeared to take it as a joke.) Jeffrey Katzenberg, who orchestrated the Walt Disney Company’s $80 million purchase of Miramax in 1993, said in a phone interview that Bob Weinstein was sometimes more aggressive than his brother in dealings with Disney. Although declining to give specifics, Mr. Katzenberg said, “I once said to him, ‘If you ever talk to somebody at my studio that way again, it’s over. You’re finished here.’” Bob Weinstein came into his own in 1996, when Dimension backed Wes Craven’s “Scream,” which cost about $15 million to make and collected $173 million worldwide, spawning a franchise. Dimension hit again in 2000, when the horror spoof “Scary Movie,” which cost $19 million to make, took in $278 million. When the brothers left Disney in 2005 to found the Weinstein Company, they took Dimension with them. But only one Dimension film in recent years has taken in more than $39 million at the domestic box office: “Paddington,” a family movie, collected $76.3 million in 2015 a sequel is planned for January. Bob Weinstein and his Dimension team are based on Hudson Street in Lower Manhattan, a two-minute walk from the Greenwich Street offices occupied by Harvey Weinstein. In recent years, according to employees and public comments by Bob Weinstein, they barely spoke to each other. When they were forced to interact, they sometimes resorted to yelling. “You need me more than I need you!” Harvey Weinstein snarled at his brother at one meeting over the summer, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Within the past year, the brothers agreed to split up the company, according to two people with direct knowledge of the plan. Bob Weinstein would take Dimension Harvey would take the Oscars-focused Weinstein Company film unit. The agreement expired last month and was contingent on a sale of the television division, which never happened. Now, with a sale to Colony perhaps imminent, the Weinstein Company may be facing a future without either brother. But Mr. Fields, Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, dismissed that notion. “Bob is going to be a key part of the new company when it’s reconstituted,” he said. “Bob expects to be the key guy.”\n",

      "BANGKOK — Capping a year of national mourning, Thailand will cremate its celebrated King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Thursday evening, in a $90 million ceremony that symbolizes both the bountiful devotion of his subjects and the earthly abundance of what many consider the world’s wealthiest monarchy. After 10 months of construction, a 164-foot-high royal pyre and pavilion — decorated with nine gilded spires, a great white umbrella and statuary of the king’s favorite pet dogs — awaits the funerary urn and coffin in which the ninth monarch of the Chakri dynasty has been placed. At the time of his death at age 88 on Oct. 13, 2016, King Bhumibol, also known as Rama IX, was the world’s longest-reigning royal — and one of the most revered. During his seven decades on the throne, he helped guide a nation prone to chronic coup-making and spasms of political violence. The cremation, which will begin at 10 p.m. in central Bangkok, is considered the concluding chapter in a journey that will return the divine monarch to the mystical Mount Meru, the heavenly heart of the Buddhist and Hindu realm. The royal pyre will be ignited by his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, whose official coronation is expected to follow soon after his father’s cremation. Royal palanquins and a golden chariot have been prepared for the five-day cremation ceremony, which weaves together 600-year-old spiritual traditions. On Friday, the king’s ashes and bones will be transported to the Grand Palace and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. In Bangkok, residents have folded more than 10 million flowers made of sandalwood, whose scent is believed to guide souls to the afterworld. Near the Grand Palace, tens of thousands of Thai mourners lined up on Wednesday to secure their spot close to the grounds of the cremation complex, despite monsoonal downpours. “The long journey and severe weather were not obstacles for me,” said Sittichai Chumwangwapee, a teacher from northeastern Thailand. “The king went to many places and through many more difficulties than this. So, compared to what our late king had to go through, this does not even represent one tiny bit of the tiredness His Majesty King Bhumibol experienced during his work.” A quarter of a million people are expected to crowd the areas surrounding the funerary grounds, while others can gather at 85 replica cremation pavilions set up across the country. On Thursday, every Thai television channel will broadcast the ceremony live. In a sign of the event’s solemnity, selfies have been discouraged at the cremation complex. “Even if it is already a year since his passing, I’m still crying,” said Amornrat Werakan, 57, a business owner who had arrived from central Thailand on Wednesday to try to witness the cremation procession. “This is a very significant loss, like losing the most important person in my life.” Since King Bhumibol’s death, millions of Thais have limited their wardrobes to black and white. With his impending cremation, Thai websites and television stations also stripped color from their content and programming. King Bhumibol’s portrait, bespectacled and sober, hangs in most public spaces and private homes. Shopping malls have been playing jazz compositions by the monarch, a keen saxophonist. The last time Thailand sent off a monarch to Mount Meru was in 1950, after the deceased king’s elder brother, Ananda Mahidol, died by gunshot in the palace four years earlier. The country, once known as Siam, had only recently been named Thailand and was still a tropical backwater of rice paddies and canals. Today, Thailand ranks as a regional manufacturing hub and global tourism destination. Over the past year, however, its export-led economy has suffered a drop in consumer spending because of the national mourning period. While King Bhumibol’s long reign was viewed as a steadying influence during an era when the country cycled through 30 prime ministers, his cremation comes at a time of political uncertainty in Thailand. His 65-year-old son, a thrice-married pilot who has spent significant time abroad, cannot rely on the kind of devotion that King Bhumibol received. In 2014, a military junta commanded by Prayuth Chan-ocha, now Thailand’s prime minister, toppled a democratically elected government led by forces loyal to a populist politician, Thaksin Shinawatra. The country has cleaved politically between a royalist elite from Bangkok and a rural populace that has suffered from Thailand’s widening income gap. Dozens have died in political violence. Though Mr. Prayuth has promised elections next year, there is no sign that the political system designed by the military, which mandates an unelected senate and has marginalized pro-Thaksin politicians, will bridge the divide. In every nationwide poll since 2001, the electorate has handed victories to parties aligned with Mr. Thaksin, a onetime telecommunications billionaire. The enduring political crisis in Thailand mirrors a rollback of democracy throughout much of Southeast Asia, where strongman rule and military power have resurged. Still, some say wider change could come in Thailand. “Anxieties have been building up since the twilight of the king’s reign but have been kept under the lid during the royal transition and year of mourning,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. “Thailand’s military government will become untenable after the cremation and as the new reign begins in earnest,” he added. “The pendulum is likely to shift back to representative government.” King Bhumibol’s reign marked Thailand’s emergence as a modern nation. Already, a nationalist dictator, Field Marshal Phibun Songkhram, had ordered Thais to wear Western clothes and banned the traditional chewing of betel nut, which stains mouths and teeth crimson. During the Vietnam War, the West depended on Thailand as a military operational base and bulwark against a rising tide of communism in the region. As a result, the Thai generals’ habit of subverting electoral politics through coups never elicited too much international criticism. While King Bhumibol was said to hover impartially above politics, both putsch-makers and democratically elected leaders needed him to sanctify their time in office. The public became accustomed to images of generals and politicians prostrating themselves in front of their constitutional monarch. Concerned about rising consumerism, King Bhumibol preached an ascetic lifestyle, even as the crown oversaw a property business that reaped billions of dollars from its ownership of prime Bangkok land, among other ventures. The deceased king’s signature development philosophy was called “sufficiency economy,” and it married support for various agrarian enterprises with a sense of financial prudence. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has not pursued such projects. Criticism of the royal family and royal institution is a serious offense in Thailand, and the number of such lèse-majesté cases has multiplied since the country returned to military rule three years ago. The army has presented itself as the foremost guardian of the Thai monarchy. One of those charged with lèse-majesté is Sulak Sivaraksa, an 84-year-old social critic and Buddhist campaigner. In 2014, Mr. Sulak questioned the details of a 16th-century elephant battle between a Thai king and a Burmese crown prince. On Oct. 9, he was charged in a military court with insulting one of King Bhumibol’s ancestors. He faces up to 15 years in jail. “When the government and military are insecure, they think the best way is to lock people up,” Mr. Sulak said. “Then they divert people’s attentions with all this decoration and ceremony.

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Mike Dubke, the White House communications director, said the visitor logs were being withheld because of “the grave national security risks and privacy concerns of the hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.

      "\n",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The White House announced Friday that it would cut off public access to visitor logs revealing who is entering the White House complex and which officials they are meeting, breaking with the Obama administration’s practice and returning a cloak of secrecy over the basic day-to-day workings of the government. The decision — which White House officials said was necessary for reasons of national security — was the latest attempt by President Trump, who has promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington, to shield his activities from scrutiny. It effectively bars the public from knowing which activists, lobbyists, political donors and others are gaining access to the president and his aides on a daily basis. It also is a stark reversal from the policy adopted by President Barack Obama, who voluntarily released more than six million White House visitor records, even as his administration fought successfully in federal court for the right to keep some of the information secret. The announcement was another turnabout for Mr. Trump after a week of changing course on an array of domestic and foreign policy matters. In a 2012 posting on Twitter, he chided Mr. Obama for failing to release certain records, including college transcripts, as President George W. Bush had. “Hiding something?” Mr. Trump wrote then. Mr. Trump has rejected other basic standards of presidential disclosures, like the release of his tax returns, leading to questions over whether he would reveal who comes and goes at the White House. Mike Dubke, the White House communications director, said the visitor logs were being withheld because of “the grave national security risks and privacy concerns of the hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.” The Obama administration for similar reasons routinely withheld records — like the identities of Mr. Obama’s young daughters’ playmates or of people attending national security or intelligence meetings — but it was not anything near a blanket policy. The new policy, reported by Time magazine, drew scathing criticism from government watchdog groups, some of which filed suit against the Trump administration this week to obtain the records. Tom Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive, said the national security argument was “a falsehood” because the Obama-era policy already made such exceptions. His organization is among three that sued the government this week for visitor logs from the White House the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. and Trump Tower. “Their action today shows they were just looking for a way to hide the logs,” Mr. Blanton said. “We went to court because we saw this coming.” Mr. Trump’s policy is a return to the one followed by presidents who preceded Mr. Obama. During Mr. Bush’s administration, government transparency groups began filing lawsuits demanding information about specific visitors to the White House, only to be stonewalled by the president’s lawyers. The issue had not been resolved by the time Mr. Obama took office, but his administration — which was exclaiming its commitment to transparency — adopted the position that visitor logs would be released with certain exceptions, in line with those recognized under the Freedom of Information Act. Although a federal court ruled in 2011 that visitor logs could be kept secret, the Obama administration continued to provide them. Lawyers still exercised what they maintained was a right to omit some entries, including in cases of highly sensitive meetings, such as interviews for prospective Supreme Court candidates and those dealing with national security or intelligence matters. And the Obamas routinely left out the names of celebrities and top donors who came to personal events at the White House, such as star-studded birthday celebrations for the president and his wife, drawing criticism for doing so. The Trump policy effectively means that none of the White House visitor logs will be available for at least five years. Under the Presidential Records Act, the public can gain access to records starting five years after the end of an administration, although the president may seek to keep them secret for up to 12 years. The issue of the logs recently gained intense attention after the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, confirmed that he was on the White House grounds when he received what he described as evidence that Mr. Trump or his closest associates might have been “incidentally” swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. Logs recording Mr. Nunes’s visit on March 21 have not been released to the public. The visitor records, maintained by the Secret Service, list the names of those entering along with which member of the White House staff obtained permission for them to enter, and the name of the person they are to meet. During the Obama administration, Republicans seized on the logs to raise questions about whether Democratic donors who invested in the solar energy company Solyndra had influenced the White House to support the firm with hundreds of millions of dollars in federal loans. They pointed to multiple White House visits by George B. Kaiser, a major Solyndra investor who had donated generously to the Obama campaign, although he denied that federal assistance for the company had been discussed during those meetings. “This new secrecy policy undermines the rule of law and suggests this White House doesn’t want to be accountable to the American people,” said Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, the conservative-aligned group that sued in 2009 for the release of the visitor records. The announcement came on a day when Mr. Trump spent his morning and early afternoon out of sight of reporters at his golf club in West Palm Beach White House aides declined, as has become their standard practice, to say what the president was doing or who he was with during his four hours at the club. Mr. Obama also went golfing with regularity during his presidency, but the White House routinely acknowledged when he was playing and gave the names of his golf partners. Democrats have introduced the “Making Access Records Available to Lead American Government Openness Act,” its Mar-a-Lago acronym a reference to Mr. Trump’s exclusive getaway, where he has made a habit of holding meetings with senior staff members and foreign leaders. The measure would require the release of visitor logs for the White House and any other location where the president conducts official business. The White House also said Friday that it was ending the contract for open.whitehouse.gov, the government disclosure site that contains the visitor log data as well as financial disclosure and salary information for White House employees. The information is available elsewhere, the White House said, calling the site a waste of taxpayer money. Ending it would save $70,000 by 2020, it said.\n",

      "Did you know that your hotel room has the potential to make you sick? If weather permits, Dr. Chopra said, opening a window in your hotel room to allow for circulation can improve air quality.

      "Did you know that your hotel room has the potential to make you sick? “Hotel rooms can be a hotbed for germs, and the lighting and poor circulation in some make for an unhealthy environment,” said Deepak Chopra, a doctor who specializes in alternative medicine and an author who is also on the advisory board of Delos, a wellness real estate firm that is focused on creating healthier indoor environments. But no matter where you hang your hat for the night, Dr. Chopra said it was possible to make your stay healthier. Here, he offers his advice on how: REDUCE CONTACT WITH GERMS  Bedspreads are notorious for holding germs, which is why many hotels use duvets with removable covers that are easy to launder. If your property doesn’t have duvets, request upon check-in that your bedspread be laundered. You can also reduce your exposure to germs by using antibacterial wipes to wipe down commonly used objects, such as television remotes, doorknobs and telephones. IMPROVE AIR CIRCULATION  Paint, furniture and cleaning products degrade the quality of the air inside because they are often made with toxic materials such as formaldehyde. And poor indoor air quality can cause headaches and fatigue. If weather permits, Dr. Chopra said, opening a window in your hotel room to allow for circulation can improve air quality. Or, choose a hotel that uses nontoxic cleaning products — the property’s reservations desk should be able to tell you if that’s the case. USE A DAWN SIMULATING ALARM CLOCK While the hotel’s alarm clock will wake you, Dr. Chopra said that waking to sudden loud noise was a stressful way to begin your day. He suggested traveling with a dawn-simulating alarm clock, which gradually transitions your room from a dim glow to full brightness and helps you wake up more naturally. “You can buy one of these alarm clocks for less than $30, and they are big in improving sleep quality,” he said. MAXIMIZE NATURAL LIGHT Light is the primary driver that aligns the body’s biological clock and sleep-wake cycle, Dr. Chopra said. “You want to rely less on artificial lighting and more on natural light, which can help improve your energy, mood and sleep when you travel,” he said. A simple way to get more natural light is to request a hotel room with a window that opens out to a street, rather than another building. Also, keep the curtains in your room open during the day so that natural light can stream in. Come nighttime, unplug the alarm clock and other electronics that emit sleep-disrupting artificial light. WATCH THE IN-ROOM SNACKS Those tempting goodies in your room’s minibar can sometimes be loaded with sugar and artificial ingredients. “Eating these processed and sugary foods is hard on digestion and can cause your energy levels to drop,” Dr. Chopra said. He advised traveling with healthy snacks such as whole fruits and raw and roasted nuts.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the franchise’s 56th season, the Houston Astros are finally champions after closing out the Los Angeles Dodgers with a 5-1 win in Game 7 of what was a thrilling World Series from start to finish. It was a Series defined by relief pitching and home runs, and Game 7 had both. Neither starting pitcher made it out of the third inning, with the teams combining to use eight relievers. On offense, the Astros were powered to victory by George Springer, the team’s center fielder, who homered for the fourth consecutive game, and tied Reggie Jackson and Chase Utley for the most home runs in a single World Series with five. “I just remember swinging and hearing the sound of the bat and I knew it was a good sound, and then I saw the flight of the ball,” said Springer, who was named Most Valuable Player. “I got to first base and I rounded third and got home, and that’s a crazy feeling. It’s a very surreal feeling because this is Game 7. This is what you dream of as a kid and for that to happen is indescribable.” Here’s how the Astros won World Series Game 7, inning by inning: Game 7 was underway at 8:22 p.m. Eastern when Yu Darvish threw a first pitch ball to George Springer of the Astros. Things went downhill fast for Darvish and the Dodgers are down, 2-0, before they’ve had a chance to bat. On Darvish’s third pitch, Springer, who has been Houston’s most consistent hitter, laced a double into the left field corner. Alex Bregman followed that up by hitting a grounder to first that looked like it would be an out, but Cody Bellinger’s throw to Darvish, who was covering the bag, went wild, allowing Springer to score. Bregman had advanced to second on the error, and he showed some aggressiveness by stealing third. The move paid off, as he was able to score on a groundout by Jose Altuve, making it 2-0. Darvish, who lasted just five outs in his Game 3 start, was able to get out of the inning by retiring Carlos Correa on a grounder to first and winning a 13-pitch battle with Yulieski Gurriel, who flew out to right. It could be another short night for Darvish if he does not improve considerably in the second inning. Waldstein: All that pumping up by the fans, the P.A. and the Dodger players came to a crashing thud when the Astros plated a run before there was an out. A lot of people expect to see Clayton Kershaw come into the game early. I spoke to Mark Teixeira on the field before the game and he had an interesting point. He thinks Kershaw was only so-so in Game 5 and if he gets into this game it will be the third time the Astros have seen him. Too risky. Teixeira also thought Darvish was rusty from a long layoff before game 2 and should be sharper tonight. Someone, maybe Kershaw, was jogging around and loosening up in the bullpen in the first inning, and at one point Darvish looked up and saw it. —- Want exclusive sports news, highlights and analysis from a rotating cast of New York Times journalists, delivered to your inbox once a week?

Just like the Astros, the Dodgers started things with a double when Chris Taylor launched a ball to the wall in right-center. Corey Seager struck out, but McCullers hit two batters with pitches, sandwiching Cody Bellinger’s latest strikeout between the beanballs. But McCullers stayed cool with the bases loaded and induced a grounder to second by Joc Pederson to end the inning. The Astros stretched their lead to 5-0 thanks to a surprising R.B.I. groundout from their pitcher and a mammoth two-run home run from the front-runner for World Series M.V.P., George Springer, who became the first player in Series history to homer in four consecutive games. Brian McCann started the inning by drawing an eight-pitch walk. Marwin Gonzalez, who has been in a terrible slump for most of the World Series, followed that by hitting a double to the wall that would have scored any runner on the Astros beyond McCann. With runners on second and third and no outs, Darvish got the first out of the inning on a soft grounder to second from Josh Reddick, but that brought up McCullers and the American League pitcher was swinging away rather than trying to bunt the slow-footed McCann home, and that strategy worked just fine as he hit a soft grounder to second that gave his battery-mate plenty of time to score. Darvish would last just one more batter, as Springer worked a full-count before getting a fastball he liked, and then he gave it a ride for his fifth home run of the World Series. In what should surprise absolutely no one, Brandon Morrow, who had pitched in each game of the World Series, and 13 of the Dodgers’ 14 playoff games, got the call to replace Darvish, and he struck out Alex Bregman on just three pitches. Lance McCullers put two more runners on base, but once again got out of the inning without allowing a run. Logan Forsythe singled to left to start things off and he advanced to second on a groundout by Austin Barnes. With a runner in scoring position and one out, Dave Roberts sent up Kike Hernandez to pinch-hit for Brandon Morrow, and he reached base on a walk. But Chris Taylor lined out to short, and Carlos Correa was able to throw behind Forsythe to double him off at second after making the catch. With Morrow out of the game, the reliever’s World Series is complete, and he became just the second pitcher to appear in seven World Series games in a single season, joining Darold Knowles of the 1973 Oakland A’s. Morrow had a disastrous appearance in Game 5, but recovered with scoreless appearances in Games 6 and 7. Waldstein: Well, even though Mark Teixeira kind of talked me out of it, Kershaw is going to pitch early in this game, as many of us thought he would. But this is not how the Dodgers envisioned it. They wanted to see Darvish go four, or so, innings and leave with a lead before handing it over to Kershaw, who would then give the ball to Kenley Jansen. Now the task is for Kershaw to keep the Astros at bay until the Dodgers can crack McCullers. They’ve been close to breaking through in the first two innings. It’s looking like a matter of time. The question remains, though, how much? With their backs against the wall, the Dodgers went to their biggest gun early, and brought in Clayton Kershaw as a reliever to start the third. He needed just 10 pitches to get three outs. The left-hander got Jose Altuve to fly out to center, Carlos Correa to fly out to right, and then caught Yulieski Gurriel looking at a 95 mile-per-hour fastball that was low in the zone but high enough for home plate umpire Mark Wegner to call strike three. Both teams are into their bullpens as Lance s once again started the inning by allowing a pair of base runners and was removed after getting one out. Brad Peacock got Houston out of the jam and the Dodgers have yet to score despite having had seven players reach base in the game. Corey Seager hit a ball to right-center that looked like it might be a double, but Seager wisely pulled up to stay at first when he realized George Springer had tracked the ball down quickly. McCullers reacted to the base-runner by hitting Justin Turner with a pitch for a second time — it was McCullers’ World Series record-setting fourth hit batter — but he got some help from Cody Bellinger when the rookie struck out on five pitches. Looking to keep the game scoreless, A.J. Hinch decided McCullers, who had thrown just 49 pitches, was done, and he brought in Peacock who got a long flyout from Yasiel Puig and then got out of the inning by striking out Joc Pederson. Waldstein: Gone are the days of Jack Morris and Sandy Koufax going the distance in a Game 7. Both of the starting pitchers are gone from this game in only the third inning. This is the first time in a World Series Game 7 that both starters did not pitch at least three innings. I expected A.J. Hinch to go longer with McCullers, but he hit four batters (Justin Turner twice) and it seemed like the Dodgers were on the verge against him during his two and one-third innings. Brad Peacock was brilliant in Game 3, but the stakes are much higher now. Clayton Kershaw worked around a one-out single to Marwin Gonzalez to pitch a second scoreless inning. He is due up to bat in the bottom half of the inning, so his day could be done. After three innings of the Dodgers getting on base, Brad Peacock threw Houston’s first 1-2-3 inning of the day. He got Logan Forsythe to ground out to third, Austin Barnes to pop out to third, and then struck out Clayton Kershaw, who was allowed to bat because there were two outs. Clayton Kershaw has pitched three scoreless innings and it is pretty clear that he would have been a better option at starter than Yu Darvish was. He started the fifth by becoming the first Dodgers pitcher of the day to retire George Springer when he got the red-hot hitter to strike out on a slider up in the zone. He struck out Alex Bregman as well and then ended the inning by getting Jose Altuve to fly out to Cody Bellinger in foul territory. Waldstein: I spoke to former Dodgers outfielder Shawn Green before the game and he said the rule of thumb at Dodger Stadium is that when there is moisture on the grass, outfielders should take five steps in, because that means there is moisture in the air, which tamps the ball down. Yasiel Puig’s fly ball to center earlier might have been an example. Astros center fielder George Springer took a few steps back and then had to run in to catch it. It took three pitchers, but Houston got through another scoreless inning, with the Dodgers stranding two more runners — bringing them to an ugly eight for the game. Brad Peacock got the first out, but after a walk and an infield single his day was done. Francisco Liriano was summoned to face Cody Bellinger, and got him to hit into a force-out, and then Chris Devenski was brought in to face Yasiel Puig, who hit a line drive right to first baseman Yuli Gurriel to end the inning. Waldstein: It has been amazing how the Dodgers have been unable to break through with men on base, even when hitting the ball hard. In the second inning they had runners at first and second with one out, but Chris Taylor lined into a double play. In the fifth, Yasiel Puig lined out to first with runners at first and third with two outs. How long can the Astros keep escaping these predicaments? Clayton Kershaw gambled to get a matchup he liked better, and the risky move paid off, resulting in a fourth scoreless inning. Carlos Correa led off with a single to left and he advanced to third base on a pair of groundouts. Marwin Gonzalez and pinch-hitter Evan Gattis were both intentionally walked, and with two outs and the bases loaded, Kershaw ended the inning by getting Cameron Maybin to pop out to third. Charlie Morton became Houston’s fifth pitcher of the day and he was immediately in trouble. Joc Pederson singled, Logan Forsythe walked and after Morton got an out on a pop-up by Austin Barnes, the Dodgers got on the board with a run-scoring single by pinch-hitter Andre Ethier, making it 5-1. Morton did not allow any further damage, striking out Chris Taylor and inducing a grounder to short by Corey Seager, which means the Dodgers have now stranded ten runners in six innings. With Ethier having pinch-hit for Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers’ bullpen will have to try to follow the example he set with four scoreless innings of relief. Waldstein: Charlie Morton is making just the second relief appearance of his career and first since his rookie season of 2008 with the Braves. But he has the temperament for it. Astros people say he is very calm and has the ability to slow things down. He certainly looked calm with that shard of Corey Seager’s bat coming at him at about 50 miles per hour. He stepped aside to avoid it, but the bat still clipped him in the leg. Unfazed, he turned and watched Carlos Correa scoop up the ball and throw Seager out for the final out of the sixth inning. Calm, indeed. It is all hands on deck for the Dodgers, with the team’s closer, Kenley Jansen, coming in for the seventh inning. It is an open question how long he can go, but he worked around a two-out walk to pitch a scoreless inning. Jansen got the first out on a long fly ball to center from George Springer that a sliding Chris Taylor was able to track down. He struck out Alex Bregman on seven pitches, but walked Jose Altuve. Altuve got Houston’s second stolen base of the Series by taking second on a first-pitch ball to Carlos Correa, but he was left there when Correa popped out to short. Charlie Morton had an incredibly quiet seventh. The right-hander got Justin Turner to pop out to first, struck out Cody Bellinger and then ended things with a groundout to short by Yulieski Gurriel. Alex Wood replaced Kenley Jansen and pitched a 1-2-3 inning, retiring Yulieski Gurriel, Brian McCann and Marwin Gonzalez. The Dodgers’ relievers have been incredible since Yu Darvish came out of the game in the second inning, but the offense has yet to offer them much help. Waldstein: Strange only using Jansen for one inning. If that were the case, then why not save him for later in case you get a lead? Meanwhile, Charlie Morton was on deck swinging with a jacket on. He would have been the fourth pitcher to hit in this game, and only one was a starter, Lance McCullers, who collected a run batted in. Clayton Kershaw and Brad Peacock also batted. Charlie Morton has successfully atoned for the run he allowed in his sixth inning by following it up with two scoreless innings. He struck out Joc Pederson, got Logan Forsythe to fly out to right, and sent the game to the ninth inning when he got Austin Barnes to fly out to center. Alex Wood was able to prevent the Astros from tacking on any insurance runs in a scoreless ninth. He struck out Charlie Morton on three pitches, Cameron Maybin on five pitches and then finished the half-inning by getting George Springer to fly out to center. The Astros are three outs away from the first championship in franchise history. A.J. Hinch had showed a preference for sticking with a hot hand in terms of his relievers, and he lived up to that by sending Charlie Morton out for a fourth inning of relief. The right-hander slammed the door on the Dodgers. He struck out pinch-hitter Chase Utley, and then got matching groundouts to second from Chris Taylor and Corey Seager to end the game before he was mobbed in the middle of the field by his teammates.\n",

      "(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Zero for three. President Trump’s latest attempt at a travel ban was blocked just hours before it was to take effect, by the same federal judge in Hawaii, Derrick K. Watson, who blocked the second ban from taking effect in March. Also, two senators reached a bipartisan deal to continue the subsidies to health insurance companies that Mr. Trump planned to cut off. We visited an Arkansas county, above, where most voters backed Mr. Trump. Health care is a job engine there — and the cloud over the Affordable Care Act has left residents uneasy. And the president’s choice to be the nation’s drug czar withdrew after reports that, as a congressman, he did the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry and undermined efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. _____ 2. Cheering and celebratory gunfire erupted in the streets of the Syrian city of Raqqa after a U.S.-backed militia composed of Kurdish and Arab fighters said they had seized it. But the American military said its allies still didn’t have complete control of the city, which had been the de facto capital of the Islamic State. And booby traps and unexploded ordnance could take years to clear. Analysts say the militant group is now preparing for a new phase: morphing back into the kind of underground insurgency it started as. _____ 3. We got the story behind the release of an American woman, her Canadian husband and their children, who were held hostage by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network. Turns out they were seen by C.I.A. drones last month near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, and the Americans gave the Pakistani government a clear message: Rescue them, or we’ll send in the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 — the unit that killed Osama bin Laden. Within hours, Pakistani forces were mobilized. _____ 4. On our podcast “The Daily,” we discuss the case of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked off a military base in Afghanistan in 2009. He pleaded guilty on Monday to desertion and endangering the troops sent to search for him. An Army judge will determine his punishment after sentencing hearings that begin next Monday. _____ 5. The fires in Northern California are still burning, but residents and public officials are beginning to grapple with the mammoth cleanup. Some of the burned debris is toxic. Rents for undamaged homes are skyrocketing, and there’s worry that the largely immigrant work force in the vineyards won’t be able to afford to stay. _____ 6. Ireland is also in the middle of a big cleanup, after one of the most powerful storms ever recorded in the northeastern Atlantic tore across the island, killing at least three people. The powerful winds from the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia carried dust from the Sahara and smoke from Iberian wildfires north, turning the sky over much of Britain — including London, above — a rusty orange. _____ 7. The billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros gave the bulk of his wealth to the Open Society Foundations, the group he founded to promote democracy and human rights. In recent years Mr. Soros, 87, has moved about $18 billion of his money into Open Society, making it the second largest foundation in the U.S. (The largest is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.) _____ 8. George Saunders’s first novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo,” won the Man Booker Prize, making it the second year in a row that Britain’s most prestigious literary award has gone to an American. The novel unfolds in a cemetery in 1862, where a grieving Abraham Lincoln visits the crypt that holds the body of his 11-year-old son, Willie, who died of typhoid fever. The judges will most likely face a renewed backlash from critics who have complained that the prize has become Americanized. Until recently, it was restricted to novels written by authors from Britain, Ireland and the Commonwealth nations. _____ 9. Gordon Hayward badly fractured his left ankle on a failed alley-oop attempt on Tuesday, less than six minutes into his first game as a member of the Boston Celtics. The injury to the star forward was a blow to the Celtics in their quest for Eastern Conference superiority it happened on the first night of the new N.B.A. season. The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Celtics, 102-99. _____ 10. Finally, Jimmy Kimmel’s filming his show in New York this week, and he has a very special guest tonight: David Letterman. Mr. Kimmel started off his Monday night show with a crack about how the city has changed in recent years. “In honor of our show being here in Brooklyn, all of the jokes you will hear tonight were written in small batches, by hand, on biodegradable hemp parchment,” he said.

      "The drama “Mudbound” debuted to a standing ovation and rave reviews earlier this year at Sundance, kicking off inevitable awards speculation, especially for its director, Dee Rees. If Ms. Rees were to land an Academy Award nomination for best director, she would be only the fifth woman, and the first black woman, to do so. Based on the novel by Hillary Jordan, “Mudbound” (due in theaters Nov. 17) tells the story of two families, one black, the other white, eking out hardscrabble lives under the scourge of fierce racism in rural Mississippi during and after World War II. Ms. Rees, whose credits include “Pariah” from 2011 and the 2015 HBO film “Bessie,” said she was drawn to “Mudbound” in part because of its lasting relevance. She also believes the question of whether progress has been made in Hollywood reveals that much still needs to change. “If you have to ask the question, you kind of know the answer,” she said. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Ms. Rees and three of the film’s stars: the singer Mary J. Blige, the British actress Carey Mulligan and the American actor Garrett Hedlund.  When the author of “Mudbound,” who is white, was writing the book, she said people cautioned against her writing black characters. It’s become a flash point for some — who gets to tell whose story. Did you think about that going in? DEE REES Well, it added to the story. The thing that attracted me was the multiplicity of voices and the interior dialogue. With characters, it just has to come from something honest somewhere. It’s a failure of imagination if you can only write what you know — we have to be able to imagine different worlds. You can’t be limited by your own experience.  Mary, you inhabited your character, Florence, on a molecular, almost spiritual level. Your long career must have informed how you played her. MARY J. BLIGE I brought in everything. My childhood. I brought in my personal life at the time. Just how, as a woman, we have to be silent sometimes until we are heard. I just gave her every single thing. By the grace of God, Dee offered me the part. REES By the grace of God, you said yes. BLIGE Well, by the grace of God, you noticed me, because people don’t notice me, you know? People don’t notice you? BLIGE I’ve always been the person that had to prove myself and show people what I have before they give. I have to work really hard, which is fine. I don’t care if you don’t notice me until you notice me.  Dee, did you know you wanted Mary for this? REES I imagined [Florence] as this woman who had to have this exterior reserve, but this raging emotional inner life and really deep sense of empathy. Mary played the Wicked Witch of the West in “The Wiz.” If you can be the Wicked Witch of the West, you can do anything. And in her musical work, her lyrics, she’s not just recounting or singing lines at you she’s living every experience. If you’ve been to her concert, it’s like therapy with 30,000 people.  Every one of you had brutal scenes. How did you recoup from that, or is that part of your job? GARRETT HEDLUND Every bit of it was quite emotional, and we had an amazing team that made it seem easy. Because it was an insanely short shoot, everybody came to play. CAREY MULLIGAN I do quite a lot of films that are emotional. So a long time ago I stopped taking it home. I did a play in New York about seven years ago where I played a paranoid schizophrenic. It was very bleak. And after that I realized I couldn’t take it home at the end of the day. I had to sort of wear a hat and take the hat off.  Even though “Mudbound” is a period film, it feels deeply relevant today. With the events in Charlottesville and neo-Nazis on the rise, do you think that people are more aware of something that black people in this country knew never went away? REES It’s like we just pulled the tablecloth off. This table’s always been here we just now pulled off the cloth and said, “Oh, wait.” So I think it’s forcing a recognition for seeing an interrogation of histories. If I can go three grandmothers back and find a slave, that means someone else can go three grandmothers back and find a slave owner. When you interrogate your histories, it forces you to rethink who you are and where you are.  Was it surprising that things maybe haven’t changed all that much? MULLIGAN I was surprised to the extent of it, that part of society still holds archaic, unforgivable beliefs about things. I’ve been shocked in the last year by the extent of it. I think I was a little bit naïve. Where people felt before they had to keep a secret, now they’re given a platform to speak these things out loud, which is crazy. BLIGE I knew that there was still racism because I would have to deal with it going in stores, or if you’re not dressed up people really —— REES They assume you’re stealing. BLIGE —— until you pull your credit card out, you know? REES I feel like a lot of it was evident during Barack Obama’s presidency. There was unprecedented disrespect, unprecedented resistance. There was a sole purpose to stonewall him. That was a version of putting him in his place. People were talking about postracial we just kind of knew that was an error. I’m fine now dressed up in these clothes and talking to you, but when I’m in the drugstore and in my sweats, the reaction is still more of suspicion. I’m treated as a thief rather than a customer. And that’s New York City today.  It’s arguably most pronounced in America, but it’s not limited to America. Set against that bleak reality, what does “Mudbound” do then? REES I think “Mudbound” reveals the interconnectiveness of our stories. You can’t separate out threads of history and race as economic construct. “Mudbound” makes it very plain. Race is about commerce it’s not an actual thing. It’s a fiction that was created to basically divide resources unequally. You couldn’t do this with someone if you saw them as another human being. You could only do it if you say, “You’re different. Manifest Destiny. God wants us to have it.” “Mudbound” unravels all that. We see these particular threads, and how their fates are woven together, and how they’re in almost a jail of their own creation. BLIGE I think that it will show us that we really need to stop all of this “I’m better than you because I have this,” or “I’m better than you because I’m this.” I know it sounds cliché, but it will show us that we are in this together. When all those storms came and Houston was flooded, the same neighbor you said you hated the other day — as you were underwater — had to help you. HEDLUND I think there’s going to be a great amount of self-reflection for everybody that watches it to see where they stand and where they’ve been. I don’t want to give away the ending I think that the best part is that it ends with love. For a film that everybody thinks is so sad, or so divided, that ends so positively, that’s a rarity.  Do you feel it’s different working for a male director versus a female director? HEDLUND I think an artist is an artist, and passion is passion. And there is no divide in that. MULLIGAN I’ve had great experiences with women and great experiences with men. I’ve had very collaborative experiences with women, probably more so. But that might just be chance. I felt on this particularly there wasn’t an idea that wasn’t fully explored. We all brought stuff that we wanted to put in. Seventy-five percent of it did get in and that’s rare. But that could just be Dee being really collaborative and wonderful. HEDLUND The most freeing thing was that we didn’t overrehearse everything and do it nine million times. Dee said from the beginning she wants to meet the characters through us, and it was just beautiful for that.  After #OscarsSoWhite and then Weinstein, people are saying we need more voices behind the camera. Do you see any change? REES I just shy away from saying, “Oh, yes, there’s progress.” We thought we’d changed in the ’60s, and when I’m 80 we’ll think, “Oh, we’ve really changed now.” I think consciousness maybe ticks upward, but in terms of behavior, we as human beings move in cycles. So we’ll see.  Are things shifting in the industry? MULLIGAN I think there is a shift in understanding, but it hasn’t affected things the way that we hope yet. REES The fact that the exception to the rule [is] a cast that looks like this, with a crew that looks like this, that all these women department heads [are] news tells you where we are. The moment it’s not news — “Oh yeah, there’s woman crews all the time” — then maybe we’ve gotten somewhere.\n",

      "City and state officials in New York have agreed to pay two men who were wrongfully convicted of setting a fire in 1980 in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn about $31 million to settle their claims of being unjustly prosecuted.

      "City and state officials in New York have agreed to pay two men who were wrongfully convicted of setting a fire in 1980 in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn about $31 million to settle their claims of being unjustly prosecuted. The early-morning blaze caused the death of a woman and her five children. The two men, Amaury Villalobos and William Vasquez, spent almost 33 years in prison on charges of murder and arson before their guilty verdicts were overturned in 2015 in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on the recommendation of the Conviction Review Unit of the Brooklyn district attorney’s office. A third man convicted in the blaze, Raymond Mora, was also cleared by the ruling, but he died in prison in 1989. According to a statement by Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, who has the power to settle claims, the city will pay Mr. Villalobos and Mr. Vasquez $9.7 million each. Officials in the office of Eric T. Schneiderman, the state attorney general, said the state had agreed to pay each man $5.75 million. “Following a careful and thorough review of the facts of this case, my office was able to reach a settlement with the claimants that will serve the best interests of all parties,” Mr. Stringer said in a statement on Friday. “We have reached an agreement that recognizes the years these men spent incarcerated and allows them and their families closure.” In February 1980, a townhouse at 695 Sackett Street burned to the ground, and the third-floor tenants — Elizabeth Kinsey, 27, and her five children — were killed. The townhouse’s owner, Hannah Quick, told the police at the time that it had been arson and that she had heard the three defendants inside the townhouse just before the fire and then had seen them walk out. Ms. Quick, a drug dealer, said she had been feuding with one or two of the men over drugs. All of the men were convicted at a trial in 1981. But years later, as she was dying, Ms. Quick told her daughter that she had lied about the men’s involvement in the fire. The case found its way to the Conviction Review Unit, whose leader, Mark J. Hale, said he had no idea how the case had proceeded to trial in the first place. In an interview conducted when the men were exonerated, Mr. Hale said that Ms. Quick’s motives to lie might have included liability for the fire and an insurance payment she received. Although a fire marshal testified at the men’s trial that he had found evidence of arson, Mr. Hale said evolving fire science disproved the 1980 analysis. Reports by experts that were filed by Mr. Villalobos’s lawyer and the district attorney’s office showed that despite the initial testimony, there was no evidence of arson and the fire was most likely an accident. “It’s a significant settlement,” Joel Rudin, Mr. Vasquez’s lawyer, said. “This is a case where the system completely failed these men.”\n",

      "\n",
      "MIAMI — Alexis K. Manigo closes her eyes to sleep and sees images of her mother. The detectives asked Ms. Manigo for a DNA sample. She was a very smart woman,” Ms. Manigo said. Ms. Manigo said about her biological mother, who could not be reached for comment. Mr. Bamberg, Ms. Manigo’s lawyer, said there were now practical matters to attend to. Ms. Manigo, somehow, has taken it all in stride so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "MIAMI — Alexis K. Manigo closes her eyes to sleep and sees images of her mother. She recalls the doting mom who took her to zoos, aquariums and SeaWorld, and marvels at how fortunate she was to have a parent who loved her unconditionally. But those memories are now complicated by an extraordinary drama that has played out over the week since Ms. Manigo, 18, found out that she had been spirited away as a newborn from a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla., that her real name is Kamiyah Mobley, and that the woman she still thinks of as her mother has been charged with her abduction. She is still trying to make sense of it all. She met with her birth parents, Craig Aiken and Shanara Mobley, last weekend. But in her first newspaper interview since the case made headlines on Friday, she said she did not have a cross word for Gloria Williams, the woman who now stands accused of lurking for more than a dozen hours around a Jacksonville hospital on the July 1998 day Ms. Manigo was born, looking for a newborn to snatch. “I feel like I was blessed,” Ms. Manigo said in a telephone interview. “I never had a reason to question a blessing like that, someone loving you so much.” Ms. Manigo said she never had cause to doubt her mother in the rural South Carolina community where she grew up. But the police say someone else clearly did. At least two tips were called in late last year to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, some 200 miles away, where the police still had an open missing-persons case. “A woman posing as a health care worker approached a young mother, then 16, with a newborn, and walked out of what was then University Medical Center with a baby and disappeared,” Sheriff Mike Williams recounted at a news conference on Friday. The woman wore flowered hospital scrubs and carried a purse, which seemed odd. “What’s she doing with a pocketbook?” the baby’s grandmother, Velma Aiken, recalled thinking in a report on the 10th anniversary of the case. “That lady could be stealing your baby.” She thought, “I’m picking up a bad spirit.” The woman spent hours with the family and then left with the baby, saying the girl had a fever and needed some tests. They never came back. “In the 18 years since that child’s abduction, we have received and followed up on more than 2,500 investigative leads,” Sheriff Williams said, recalling an “intense, lengthy, detailed, multiagency investigation.” The family reached a legal settlement with the hospital two years later. And every year, the baby’s mother would wrap a slice of birthday cake in tinfoil and freeze it. The case also went cold. Late last year, two fresh tips came in, and they led cold-case detectives to Walterboro, S.C., a town of just 5,000 people an hour west of Charleston. There, the investigators found a young woman who had been born on July 10, 1998, just like Kamiyah, but with a different name. Her documents were fraudulent, Sheriff Williams said, and “interviews with people” supported the idea that the two women were one and the same. The detectives asked Ms. Manigo for a DNA sample. “And of course, like someone who understands their rights, she said: ‘What is this about? Do you have a warrant?’” said her lawyer, Justin Bamberg. The investigators returned with one. Ms. Manigo gave her DNA and in short order found out the truth: She was someone else’s child. Conscious of the fact that the woman she knew as her mother will now face trial for kidnapping, Ms. Manigo is unwilling to discuss a lot about the case, including how her family life finally unraveled. She does not want to say which name she plans to use in the future, and she insisted that she was never suspicious — although the police said otherwise at a news conference on Friday. “I never had any ID or a driver’s license, but other than that, everything was totally normal,” she said. She did acknowledge being stymied a few months ago when she applied for work at Shoney’s but lacked the Social Security card she needed to get the job. “She took care of everything I ever needed,” Ms. Manigo said. “I never wanted for anything. I always trusted her with it.” She said that Ms. Williams was not mentally ill and that she had not been overprotective. Ms. Williams worked at a Navy yard handling medical records and was set to receive her master’s degree this year. “She was a very smart woman,” Ms. Manigo said. Ms. Manigo met her biological parents on Saturday, at a teary reunion followed by a mother-daughter trip to the mall. She called them Mom and Dad, because she figured those were words they had been waiting a long time to hear. “You can tell she has a lot of love for me as well,” Ms. Manigo said about her biological mother, who could not be reached for comment. “They don’t feel like stranger-strangers. They feel like distant family.” She said she felt an innate trust toward them. Her father, Craig Aiken, told WJXT-TV in Jacksonville the meeting was “beautiful.” “It’s a feeling that you can’t explain,” he said. Mr. Bamberg, Ms. Manigo’s lawyer, said there were now practical matters to attend to. She needs identification and a Social Security card. A large financial settlement was won on her behalf, and now that she is 18, it has to be determined whether any money was set aside for her. “You have incidents where people’s lives were turned upside down, and then you have this: a life that was essentially erased,” he said. Among the few people who can really relate to what Ms. Mobley is experiencing is Sarah Cecilie Finkelstein Waters. When she was a preschooler living with her mother, her father took her, and it was not until she was a teenager and saw her picture on a milk carton that she realized that she had been abducted. Ms. Waters eventually reconnected with her mother, distanced herself from her father and, as an adult, befriended other survivors of abduction. “It turns reality upside down and forces you to question every core thing you ever believed to be true,” said Ms. Waters, now 46, married and a mother herself, living on Long Island. “You have to really struggle to come to terms with all these shades of gray, make sense of them, and hopefully some sort of peace with them: What is reality? Who is wrong and who’s right? Who really loves me? Who is telling the truth?” Since Ms. Mobley seems devoted to the woman she believed was her mother, Ms. Waters said, “She needs to feel like she can embrace her new family without giving up on her old one.” Geoffrey Greif, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Social Work who has studied abduction cases, said some psychological effects were common. “As you connect the dots over a period of time, it’s a pretty normal reaction to become upset with the abductor, and a child who was abducted may have trouble developing intimacy and trust with other people,” he said. “We often see a degree of anger at the parents who were left behind, even if that’s not really justified, like ‘Why didn’t you look harder for me?’” But cases like Ms. Mobley’s are quite rare. Thousands of children are abducted each year, but usually the abductor is a family member, most often a parent. And abduction by a stranger often has a tragic end — sexual abuse, death or both. A spokesman for the hospital, which is now called UF Health Jacksonville, said the medical center was thrilled that the young woman had been found. “We share in the joy of this discovery with her family, the northeast Florida community, and law enforcement as they celebrate this news,” the spokesman, Dan Leveton, said in a statement. “Like most hospitals, we currently have specialized, state-of-the-art security measures in place, both personnel-based and electronic, to protect newborns and their mothers.” Ms. Manigo, somehow, has taken it all in stride so far. And for her, Mom still means Ms. Williams, who is being held at the Jacksonville jail without bond. “When I close my eyes, I see my mother,” she said. “I like that. I love that.”\n",

      "BEIJING — President Trump’s $250 billion in Chinese business deals probably won’t be enough to stop a trade fight.

      "\n",
      "BEIJING — President Trump’s $250 billion in Chinese business deals probably won’t be enough to stop a trade fight. Mr. Trump met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on Thursday, offering personal praise and qualified criticisms of China’s trade practices. China, in return, offered modest concessions on some thorny trade issues. The two sides also pointed to what they claimed were billions of dollars of deals between Chinese and American companies to show face-saving progress. But behind the scenes, Washington and Beijing are gearing up for what may well be months of contentious relations between the world’s two largest trading partners. After initially focusing this year on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and the United States’ free-trade pact with South Korea, Trump administration officials plan to pursue previous promises to investigate what they call Chinese theft of American intellectual property. Lawmakers also plan to intensify scrutiny of Chinese investments in sensitive areas of the American economy. Mr. Trump hinted at coming tensions on those fronts on Thursday, saying he hoped to address “the chronic imbalance in our relationship as it pertains to trade.” “This includes addressing China’s market access restrictions and technology transfer requirements,” he said, “which prevent American companies from being able to fairly compete within China.” Both countries face pressure to show their reasonable sides ahead of what could be a difficult fight. Mr. Trump made harsh criticism of trade with China a centerpiece of his campaign for president and faces pressure to deliver on promises to level the playing field and close the yawning American trade deficit with China. At the same time, he is seeking China’s help containing North Korea, and on other issues. Mr. Trump struck a somewhat more conciliatory tone in front of his Chinese hosts. While China’s trade practices are unfair, he said, that stemmed mainly from what he called the failings of his predecessors. “Right now, unfortunately, it is a very unfair and one-sided one,” Mr. Trump said of the two countries’ trading relationship. “But I don’t blame China, after all. Who can blame a country for taking advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens?” Mr. Xi faces his own pressures. Though he solidified his political base at a major Communist Party meeting last month, he must contend with a maturing economy now saddled with a mountain of debt. He is also leading an ambitious plan to upgrade China’s technological know-how — an effort that could be complicated by a trade fight with the United States. The two sides took pains on Thursday to show common ground. The Chinese government announced near the end of Mr. Trump’s visit that it planned to reduce tariffs on imported cars and to open up its financial sector to greater competition. But Chinese officials offered no promises on when or how much they might be willing to move on either issue. The Chinese offers represented a bid to strengthen support for a less assertive American trade policy by reaching out to two industries that have a lot to lose. One is Wall Street, which has profited handsomely from helping Chinese companies and the Chinese government to buy American companies and real estate. The other is Detroit’s automakers, which have seen strong sales in China of cars  built almost entirely in Chinese factories by Chinese workers and robots using Chinese parts. Thanks to Chinese tariffs, cars made in the United States are too expensive to compete broadly in China. But the Trump administration’s negotiators made little attempt during the visit to seek such industry-specific promises, believing that previous efforts had resulted in little progress. Instead, Mr. Trump oversaw on Thursday the signing of more than $250 billion in largely symbolic business deals. Most of them appeared to be the kinds of deals that American companies have long struck in China. Qualcomm, the chip maker, said on Thursday that it had struck deals with Chinese smartphone makers to sell them a total of $12 billion in components over the next three years. Qualcomm already counts on China for more than half of its revenue, and the deals it signed on Thursday were with existing customers. Boeing said it had agreed to sell planes valued at $37 billion at list prices to Chinese customers. Financial terms were not disclosed. Air Products &amp Chemicals, an industrial gases company, said it would build a $3.5 billion plant with a Chinese partner to turn coal into gases, adding that it already supplied gases to the first phase of the project, in the Chinese city of Yulin. Trump administration officials and some business executives said the deals would not have occurred without Mr. Trump’s visit. “This event helped make this one happen,” said Mitch Snyder, the president and chief executive of Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron, which signed an agreement on Wednesday to deliver 50 five-person Bell 505 light-duty civilian helicopters built in Texas. He declined to disclose a price. Errol D. Rice, the executive vice president and managing director of the Montana Stockgrowers Association, said that a $300 million beef deal signed on Wednesday with JD.com, a Chinese electronic commerce company, had happened only in the last few weeks. The Chinese ambassador to the United States had expressed interest in September, he said, and within three weeks JD.com was negotiating to buy $200 million worth of Montana beef over the next three years and to build a $100 million beef-processing facility in southern Montana. One new agreement involved Alaskan natural gas. The state of Alaska signed a deal with Sinopec, a Chinese oil giant, and Chinese banks for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from near the North Slope of Alaska to a port, and for the construction of a liquefied natural gas loading terminal. China would then buy much of the gas, in a deal that American officials said could be worth $40 billion or more in the coming years. But the agreement fell short of a deal. “We are really positive about this project, but what we are going to sign this time is a letter of intent for mutual cooperation, not a contract,” said Lu Dapeng, the press office director of Sinopec. “The area definitely has the resources, but it still requires extensive research and analysis to determine how big is the market and then to decide on the scale of the final cooperation accordingly.” “This needs time,” Mr. Lu added.\n",

      "\n",
      "I was 11 when I read my first romance novel. Where Eagles Dare,” by Alistair MacLean. The only silk to be found in an Alistair MacLean novel is on a parachute. One of the few MacLean novels I didn’t love was one of his most famous, “H.M.S. Ulysses. H.M.S. Ulysses AN ALISTAIR MACLEAN STARTER KIT\n",
      "\n",
      "I was 11 when I read my first romance novel. It was “Where Eagles Dare,” by Alistair MacLean. I was home from school sick with something that kept me snuffling under a snowdrift of rumpled tissues, and had read every book on my shelf. In my older brother’s room, the only novel I could find was MacLean’s World War II thriller. I read his book in an afternoon, transported to Schloss Adler, an impregnable Nazi fortress in the Bavarian Alps where an American general was held captive. As soon as the daring rescue was done, I ransacked my brother’s room and discovered an entire cache of Alistair MacLean. In between bouts of wheezing, I devoured one after the other: “South by Java Head,” “When Eight Bells Toll,” “The Guns of Navarone,” “Night Without End,” “Ice Station Zebra” and, my favorite, “The Golden Rendezvous.” Years later, I understood that these were in fact romance novels for boys, which means very little romance and lots of danger, complicated weaponry and battle-forged camaraderie. Historical romances are known as “bodice-rippers.” The only silk to be found in an Alistair MacLean novel is on a parachute. But I had never read a real romance novel — I hadn’t yet discovered Jane Austen or Georgette Heyer. So these action thrillers were the first books I read that filled my head with fantasies of love and courtship. I was like Titania, who under Puck’s spell in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” falls in love with the first person she sees. I was so captivated it didn’t matter that the heroine was secondary or that the wooing was perfunctory and mostly took place under gunfire while climbing the cliffs of a Greek island or escaping the Japanese in a lifeboat in the South China Sea. We lived in Paris and I went to a French all girl’s school where teachers limited our reading to a children’s imprint called La Bibliothèque Rose. I couldn’t share my MacLean fixation with my best friend because she would only read novels on the prescribed pink list. So mine was a lonely passion, deepened in a way by the solitary communion with bosuns, saboteurs and germ warfare specialists. These heroes were all loners, strong and mostly silent. They didn’t chase women or even miss them. Sometimes, in the middle of a covert operation or a terrorist heist, a beautiful girl would come along and briefly win the hero’s heart, before he had to shove his feelings back in the glove compartment, pick up a marlin spike and 1,000 rounds of ammunition and save the world — while making the occasional wisecrack. And that is what made “The Golden Rendezvous” my favorite. It was written in 1962 and set aboard a luxury freighter that is hijacked by pirates smuggling a tactical nuclear weapon. The plot was suspenseful but what I liked best was the sardonic first-person narration by its hero, First Officer John Carter. “A hand touched my arm,” Carter says. “Captain Bullen again, I thought drearily it had been at least half an hour since he’d been around last to talk to me about my shortcomings, and then I realized that, whatever the captain’s caprices, wearing Chanel No. 5 wasn’t one of them. This would be Miss Beresford.” Susan Beresford is of course the love interest: a willowy, auburn-haired heiress whose hauteur and needling humor mask a tender heart. Carter can’t stand her — until he does. MacLean was Scottish and another thing I intuitively liked was that his heroes were mostly rough-hewed social nobodies formed by World War II and not on the playing fields of Eton like James Bond. I didn’t know much about British class snobbery then, but I sided with outsiders. One of the few MacLean novels I didn’t love was one of his most famous, “H.M.S. Ulysses.” It was his first and based on his own wartime experiences and it describes the perilous Arctic travails of a British cruiser escorting merchant ships delivering materiél to the Soviet Union. But “H.M.S. Ulysses” didn’t include a love story, and my attention stumbled over what seemed like endless descriptions of scuppers and fo’c’sles. Many years later I read another classic about the Arctic convoys: “The Cruel Sea,” by Nicholas Monsarrat. I was by then old enough to appreciate the brutal cold and endless terror those sailors endured. “The Cruel Sea” had a pallid romance tucked into a subplot, but that didn’t interest me at all I just wanted to get back to the men on the ship. I was certain that Monsarrat’s novel was infinitely better than my memory of “H.M.S. Ulysses.” Then I recently picked up “H.M.S. Ulysses” and saw that once again, I was wrong. “H.M.S. Ulysses” has a different tone than “The Cruel Sea,” there is more of MacLean’s blend of irreverence and sentimentality, but it is as suspenseful as any of his others and certainly the most moving. So that course correction reminded me of something I learned when I read “Anna Karenina” as an adult. When I first speed-read it as a teenager, all I cared about was the heroine’s love affair with Vronsky. Years later, after I had a child of my own, I was mostly consumed by the fact that Anna abandoned her young son for her lover. Not too long ago, I read it again and discovered that I really didn’t care about Anna or Vronsky or their children. I couldn’t wait to see what happened to Levin’s plans for agricultural reform on his estates. People don’t outgrow romance, but their taste in romance novels can evolve. I still read a lot of war novels and espionage thrillers. But now I don’t really care if he gets the girl. Now that I am all grown up, the real romance is in seeing how the job gets done.

      "Bobby Hutcherson, one of the most admired and accomplished vibraphonists in jazz, died on Monday at his home in Montara, Calif. He was 75. Marshall Lamm, a spokesman for Mr. Hutcherson’s family, confirmed the death, saying Mr. Hutcherson had long been treated for emphysema. Mr. Hutcherson’s career took flight in the early 1960s, as jazz was slipping free of the complex harmonic and rhythmic designs of bebop. He was fluent in that language, but he was also one of the first to adapt his instrument to a freer postbop language, often playing chords with a pair of mallets in each hand. He released more than 40 albums and appeared on many more, including some regarded as classics, like “Out to Lunch,” by the alto saxophonist, flutist and bass clarinetist Eric Dolphy, and “Mode for Joe,” by the tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson. Both of those albums were a byproduct of Mr. Hutcherson’s close affiliation with Blue Note Records, from 1963 to 1977. He was part of a wave of young artists who defined the label’s forays into experimentalism, including the pianist Andrew Hill and the alto saxophonist Jackie McLean. But he also worked with hard-bop stalwarts like the tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon, and he later delved into jazz-funk and Afro-Latin grooves. Mr. Hutcherson had a clear, ringing sound, but his style was luminescent and coolly fluid. More than Milt Jackson or Lionel Hampton, his major predecessors on the vibraphone, he made an art out of resonating overtones and chiming decay. This coloristic range of sound, which he often used in the service of emotional expression, was one reason for the deep influence he left on stylistic inheritors like Joe Locke, Warren Wolf, Chris Dingman and Stefon Harris, who recently assessed him as “by far the most harmonically advanced person to ever play the vibraphone.” Robert Hutcherson was born in Los Angeles on Jan. 17, 1941. His father, Eli, was a brick mason, and his mother, Esther, was a hairdresser. Growing up in a black community in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Hutcherson was drawn to jazz partly by way of his older siblings: His brother, Teddy, had gone to high school with Mr. Gordon, and his sister, Peggy, was a singer who worked with the Gerald Wilson Orchestra. (She later toured and recorded with Ray Charles as a Raelette.) Mr. Hutcherson, who took piano lessons as a child, often described his transition to vibraphone as the result of an epiphany: Walking past a record store one day, he heard a recording of Milt Jackson and was hooked. A friend at school, the bassist Herbie Lewis, further encouraged his interest in the vibraphone, so Mr. Hutcherson saved up and bought one. He was promptly booked for a concert with Mr. Lewis’s band. “Well, I hit the first note,” he recalled of that performance in a 2014 interview with JazzTimes. But, he added, “from the second note on it was complete chaos. You never heard people boo and laugh like that. I was completely humiliated. But my mom was just smiling, and my father was saying, ‘See, I told you he should have been a bricklayer.’” Mr. Hutcherson persevered, eventually working with musicians like Mr. Dolphy, whom he had first met when Mr. Dolphy was his sister’s boyfriend, and the tenor saxophonist and flutist Charles Lloyd. In 1962, he joined a band led by a pair of Count Basie sidemen, the tenor saxophonist Billy Mitchell and the trombonist Al Grey, and it brought him to New York City for a debut engagement at Birdland. The group broke up not long afterward, but Mr. Hutcherson stayed in New York, driving a taxicab for a living, his vibraphone stashed in the trunk. He was living in the Bronx and married to his high school sweetheart, the former Beth Buford, with whom he had a son, Barry — the inspiration for his best-known tune, the lilting modernist waltz “Little B’s Poem.” Mr. Hutcherson caught a break when Mr. Lewis, his childhood friend, came to town and introduced him to the trombonist Grachan Moncur III, who in turn introduced him to Mr. McLean. “One Step Beyond,” an album by Mr. McLean released on Blue Note in 1963, featured Mr. Hutcherson’s vibraphone as the only chordal instrument. From that point on, he was busy. The first album he released as a leader was “Dialogue” (1965), featuring Mr. Hill, the trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and the saxophonist and flutist Sam Rivers. Among his notable subsequent albums was “Stick-Up!” (1966), with Mr. Henderson and the pianist McCoy Tyner among his partners. He and Mr. Tyner would forge a close alliance. After being arrested for marijuana possession in Central Park in 1967, Mr. Hutcherson lost his cabaret card, required of any musician working in New York clubs. He returned to California and struck a rapport with the tenor saxophonist Harold Land. Among the recordings they made together was “Ummh,” a funk shuffle that became a crossover hit in 1970. (It was later sampled by the rapper Ice Cube.) In the early ’70s Mr. Hutcherson bought an acre of land along the coast in Montara, where he built a house. He lived there with his wife, the former Rosemary Zuniga, whom he married in 1972. She survives him, along with their son, Teddy, a marketing production manager for the organization SFJazz his son Barry, a jazz drummer and two grandchildren. After his tenure on Blue Note, Mr. Hutcherson released albums on Columbia, Landmark and other labels, working with Mr. Tyner, the tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins and — onscreen, in the 1986 Bertrand Tavernier film “Round Midnight” — with Mr. Gordon and the pianist Herbie Hancock. From 2004 to 2007, Mr. Hutcherson toured with the first edition of the SFJazz Collective, an ensemble devoted equally to jazz repertory and the creation of new music. He was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2010. After releasing a series of albums on the European label Kind of Blue, he returned to Blue Note in 2014 to release a soul-jazz effort, “Enjoy the View,” with the alto saxophonist David Sanborn and other collaborators. Speaking in recent years, Mr. Hutcherson was fond of citing a bit of insight from an old friend. “Eric Dolphy said music is like the wind,” he told The San Francisco Chronicle in 2012. “You don’t know where it came from, and you don’t know where it went. You can’t control it. All you can do is get inside the sphere of it and be swept away.”\n",

      "WASHINGTON — It hasn’t been evangelicals reaching into the White House. It’s been the White House reaching out to evangelicals.

Tony Perkins, the president of the evangelical Family Research Council, said that evangelicals would give Mr. Trump a “mulligan.\n",
      "\n",
      "WASHINGTON — When the White House wants to gather evangelicals for one of its many issue-specific “listening sessions,” the Rev. Johnnie Moore is often one of the first to hear. It wasn’t always clear that Mr. Moore, a 34-year-old Southern Baptist minister who was a co-chairman of the Trump campaign’s evangelical advisory board, would be a frequent White House guest. Some critics, and even some evangelicals, wondered whether conservative Christians’ sometimes uneasy alliance with the Trump campaign was a marriage of convenience that would be abandoned after Inauguration Day. But one year in, conservative religious leaders are hailing the president’s actions in office. “This White House, the front door is open to evangelicals,” said Mr. Moore, who estimates that he has visited at least 20 times since Mr. Trump took office, averaging nearly once every other week. “It hasn’t been evangelicals reaching into the White House. It’s been the White House reaching out to evangelicals. Not a day goes by when there aren’t a dozen evangelical leaders in the White House for something.” This week will be a culmination of those ties. On Thursday, Mr. Moore will join what he calls the “Super Bowl for peacemakers” here: the annual National Prayer Breakfast, where around 3,000 clergy members, politicians and business leaders will eat, network and listen to speeches, including one from President Trump. Mr. Trump will stand before an audience that has cheered the president’s first-year agenda as its own: announcing that the American Embassy in Israel would move to Jerusalem, anointing a national “prayer Sunday,” appointing Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, signing anti-abortion legislation, opening a “conscience and religious freedom division” at the Department of Health and Human Services and fighting to end the Johnson Amendment, which threatens religious organizations with the loss of their tax-exempt status if they endorse political candidates. Many evangelicals did not see such a list of accomplishments as inevitable. Mr. Trump’s formal evangelical advisory board ended with the campaign. But his continued attention to evangelical causes is not a coincidence. Mr. Moore and others have helped remnants of the board remain active in the White House, providing the administration with a constellation of religious figures to lend its platform gravitas among evangelicals. Mr. Moore, a former Liberty University vice president who now lives in California, is one of around a half-dozen original members of the evangelical advisory group who pays regular visits to the White House, which can start with policy briefings from West Wing staff and agency officials and end with impromptu visits to the Oval Office, where Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will banter, then pray, with them. The group, which also includes Tim Clinton, Robert Jeffress, Darrell Scott, Samuel Rodriguez and Paula White, who has been called Mr. Trump’s personal “spiritual adviser,” is a frequent and influential voice in the ears of senior administration officials. Jennifer Korn, who as a deputy director of the public liaison office manages contact between the White House and faith groups, sends out invitations to policy briefings and the “listening sessions.” Ms. Korn invites senior West Wing advisers such as Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Kellyanne Conway to visit the groups, which range from 20 to 100 guests and are often tied to specific faith-related legislation, executive orders and court appointments. Ms. Trump recently sat in on a meeting with female faith leaders that Mr. Moore and Mr. Jeffress attended. “We are the front door to the White House,” Ms. Korn said, echoing Mr. Moore’s words. Mr. Jeffress, another core member from the campaign board, has been one of Mr. Trump’s most reliable evangelical advocates, regularly appearing with him in Trump Tower in New York and then in the White House. “I can’t look into the president’s heart to know if he really personally believes these positions he’s advocating, or whether he thinks it’s smart politics to embrace them because of the strong evangelical influence in the country,” Mr. Jeffress said in an interview. “But frankly, I don’t care. As a Christian, I’m seeing these policies embraced and enacted, and he’s doing that.” Mr. Jeffress, who once said President Barack Obama’s politics could lead to the rise of the Antichrist, said the issues that evangelicals discuss at the White House “go beyond what most assume,” including opioid abuse and criminal justice overhaul. He and Mr. Moore are sympathetic to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, that shields young undocumented immigrants, which is often viewed as a progressive cause. When he is in the Oval Office with faith leaders, Mr. Moore said, they try to “personalize” issues for Mr. Trump, including in a recent discussion on DACA, when the group told the president that he should view the issue as a father and grandfather. Mr. Moore, who has spent time in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Bahrain and Israel speaking out against religious persecution, said that evangelical advocacy in the White House also helped expedite the confirmation of former Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas as ambassador for international religious freedom, a post for which he and the core group of evangelical voices in the White House had long pushed. Evangelicals voted heavily in Mr. Trump’s favor in the presidential election and, polls show, continue to back him. “Evangelicals were so great to me,” Mr. Trump said last year. Yet the symbiosis between conservative Christians and Mr. Trump was never perfect, and some of that tension has lingered into his presidency. The Rev. A. R. Bernard, the pastor of the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn and a member of the campaign board, announced that he was no longer associating with the White House evangelical group after Mr. Trump’s failure to condemn white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville, Va., in August. Mr. Bernard, who said he had made at least four visits to the White House, saw Mr. Trump as largely indifferent to faith leaders’ to-do list. “There was nothing hidden. He wanted that voting bloc. He wanted their votes,” Mr. Bernard said of Mr. Trump’s engagement with evangelicals during the campaign. “It was transactional. He wanted to do whatever he thought would get those votes.” When reports emerged last month that a pornographic-film actress was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about her claims of an affair she had with Mr. Trump, it further complicated his relationship with evangelicals, who maintained that it is not the responsibility of the president to live a pure life. “He’s not the pastor of our country,” Franklin Graham, a member of the camp advisory board, said on television. Tony Perkins, the president of the evangelical Family Research Council, said that evangelicals would give Mr. Trump a “mulligan.” Mr. Jeffress agreed. “Evangelical support for President Trump has always been based on his policies, not on his personal piety,” he said. Mr. Scott, a pastor at the New Spirit Revival Center in the Cleveland area, is one of the early members of the campaign advisory board who continues to visit Mr. Trump in the White House. He said Mr. Trump’s interest in evangelicalism stemmed not from opportunism but from wanting to atone for a life largely devoid of conventional religiosity. Mr. Scott said that the president’s bluster was withheld when he visited with faith leaders, and that Mr. Trump would often apologize if he cursed in front of them. “I find his reverence for clergy very old-school,” Mr. Scott said. “When he’s in the room with clergy, he adopts the position of the lesser. He seems to regard the clergy as the greater.” Mr. Trump has the view of “while you guys were off pursuing a higher calling, I was off building buildings,” Mr. Scott said. “Now it’s time for me to catch up.” This week, as he shuffled from meeting to meeting and dinner to dinner ahead of the prayer breakfast, Mr. Moore said he hoped evangelicals’ new clout in Washington would give them a new face. “People sort of think of evangelicals as these bumpkins. That always drives me crazy,” Mr. Moore said before he dashed out of a downtown Washington cafe. “I think we are far more informed than people give us credit for.”\n",

      "For Pav Sterry of Columbus, Ohio, legalizing any undocumented immigrants — even those who came as children without a choice in the matter — is just plain wrong. Huy Pham of St. Paul believes any concessions for the so-called Dreamers will unleash another tidal wave of illegal immigration. And Daniel Cotts of Phoenix regards “blanket amnesty” for them as unfair to foreigners who languish for years waiting to come here the legal way. Poll after poll has shown that a large majority of Americans support protections for young immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children. Yet there remains a slice of the American public for whom the idea of legalizing an undocumented immigrant has not gotten better with age. They do not dispute that most of the immigrants are eager and hardworking and did not choose their station in life. But for these voters, that is all beside the point. “I think DACA recipients should be given a few months to get their affairs in order and return to their home countries,” said Ms. Sterry, 58, a former math teacher, referring to the Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that President Trump has ended but which could be revived or replaced in a congressional deal. And to those who contend that the young immigrants would be marooned in a country they do not remember, Ms. Sterry says: “Parents and children can all go home together.” Less than a quarter of American voters, and in some polls as few as one in 10, share Ms. Sterry’s beliefs. But they show how the country’s conflicted emotions about undocumented immigrants have stymied legislation for more than a decade, polarizing both parties and most recently leading to the short-lived government shutdown that still did not settle the issue. Their counterparts on the liberal side are the progressives who are upset with Senate Democrats like Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, for allowing the government to reopen without a guarantee of protection for DACA recipients, known as Dreamers. On the Republican side, moderates are feeling the pull of hard-line members who want any legalization bill to incorporate significant changes to immigration enforcement, including measures Democrats generally oppose, such as funding for a border wall, a sharp reduction in overall migration, and a shift to merit-based admissions from a family-based system that critics call “chain migration.” President Trump has repeatedly expressed support for legalizing DACA recipients — on Wednesday, he said he was open to granting them a path to citizenship “at some point in the future, over a period of 10 to 12 years.” But he, too, has felt the pull from people in his administration who objected to the program, which was created by former President Barack Obama in 2012. In announcing the end of DACA last September, Attorney General Jeff Sessions called it a “unilateral executive amnesty” that had encouraged more illegal immigration and “denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens.” Lars Larson, a syndicated conservative talk-show host based in Portland, Ore., said that 10 to 15 percent of his callers consider DACA recipients lawbreakers and want to give them “nothing at all.” “I point out that philosophically, I agree with them, but practically this needs to be resolved,” he said, by granting permission to stay only in exchange for tougher enforcement measures. “Show us that you are bringing something of value.” In interviews, voters who oppose legalization said that they felt the government was being held hostage by sympathizers of the young immigrants. Most were resigned to the possibility that a deal could happen, and said that they could live with it if conservatives came away with significant new immigration controls. Still, several invoked the law signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, which granted 2.7 million people amnesty while tightening security at the Mexican border and adding strict penalties for employers who hired undocumented workers. Though it promised to reduce illegal immigration, the number of undocumented people has grown since then to an estimated 11 million. “Granting legal status to Dreamers could potentially cause a domino effect in which other families bring young children, hoping that in time their children will be granted legal status,” said Jaclyn Haak, 19, a chemical engineering student at the University of Minnesota. She acknowledged that many DACA recipients are contributing to the economy, but said that this did not mean that legalizing them was in the country’s best interest. She said it could undermine job prospects for Americans, echoing a concern by immigration restrictionist groups. For Joe Kleve, 21, a senior at St. Mary’s University of Minnesota in Winona, the argument that the young immigrants had been brought by their parents held no weight. What if someone’s parents were caught sneaking their whole family into a movie without paying, he asked. “Are they going to just kick the parents out?” For Mr. Pham, 39, the issue was personal. He, too, arrived in the United States as a toddler, as a legally admitted refugee from Vietnam. But until his family could find American sponsors, they were parked in a refugee camp overseas for more than a year. “If we can do it the legal way, so can they,” said Mr. Pham, an information technology consultant. “We don’t have to be creating new programs or giving them preferential treatment.” The voters opposing legalization were often well-informed about some of the details of the immigration debate, such as E-Verify, an electronic worker-verification system that many Republicans want to make mandatory for employers, and the diversity visa lottery, which admits up to 50,000 foreigners a year who must be vetted, but do not need any special skills or family ties to the United States. Proposals to eliminate the lottery have been circulating for years. At the same time, a few of those interviewed held to common misconceptions about the young immigrants. Some said the immigrants should not be allowed to become legal if they had not tried to do so before DACA was created. But it is almost impossible for people to secure green cards once they have been here illegally for several years. Others expressed the sentiment that the immigrants’ parents should have gotten “in line,” though for many foreigners, a legal pathway into the country exists only if they have special skills or relatives in the United States who are citizens. While these voters remain in the minority, support is not absolute among the majority who want to legalize the young immigrants. In a CNN poll last week, 84 percent of those surveyed said they supported legal status for Dreamers. But when given a choice between keeping the government open and passing DACA legislation, 56 percent of those polled said it was more important to keep the government open and only 34 percent said a legalization bill was more important, with the rest believing they were equally important or having no opinion. The lack of firm support for the shutdown most likely contributed to Democrats’ decision to end it on Monday. And for those who disdain legalization, that feeling is not always absolute, either. When pressed on whether deportations of the young immigrants should begin — a distinct possibility if no deal is reached — some hedged their opposition. “They’d be sent back to countries they have no connection to, don’t know anything about — it’s a very complex situation,” said Mr. Cotts, a lawyer, adding that he would like lawmakers to “find a middle ground,” perhaps one that prohibits the immigrants from becoming citizens with voting rights. Mr. Pham suggested letting the immigrants stay, but expelling all those who commit crimes, or even get speeding tickets. “If they’re here already, and they are contributing to society, leave them alone,” he said. He said he did not want them becoming citizens, but then added he would entertain the thought for those who served in the military. Ms. Sterry, however, stuck to her stance. “Let’s not pretend this is only about the children,” she said. Once the young immigrants are legalized, support will mount for legalizing their parents, too, she believed. When asked about what it felt like to take an unpopular position, Ms. Sterry responded: “I don’t care about being popular. Amnesty is wrong.”\n",

      "\n",
      "At the start of his Air Force career, Devin P. Kelley was picked for a demanding and selective intelligence analyst school. For Mr. Kelley, the military was likely an encouraging option at first. Mr. Kelley washed out before graduation. Mr. Kelley’s next assignment was decidedly less demanding. Mr. Kelley was so emotionally unstable and unfocused, Ms. Edwards said, that he often would not do his work. The shooter, it’s Kelley,” the text said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the start of his Air Force career, Devin P. Kelley was picked for a demanding and selective intelligence analyst school. He walked into his first Monday of class with a crisp blue uniform, shined shoes, and for perhaps the first time in years, with hope. It didn’t last. Two years later, he found himself on the run, in a bleak El Paso bus station at midnight trying to catch the first Greyhound back home after failing out of school, being charged with assault and escaping from a psychiatric hospital. As he waited in jean shorts and a hooded sweatshirt, the ticket in his hand was proof he had once again failed. For Mr. Kelley, who last Sunday opened fire on a rural Texas church, killing 26 people, the Air Force could have been a turning point — a source of discipline and direction that he had not embraced in a troubled childhood. But military records and interviews with fellow airmen show that despite repeated chances, his career fell apart under the weight of his depression and rage, at a time when his mind was churning with half-laid plans to kill his superiors. After only a few months in the service, Mr. Kelley slid back into a long decline that left a wreckage of broken relationships, criminal convictions and eventually bloodshed. “The Air Force tried to give him chances but he was just problem after problem after problem,” said Jessika Edwards, a former Air Force staff sergeant who worked with Mr. Kelley in 2011, near the end of his career. “He was a dude on the edge,” Ms. Edwards added, noting that he would appear at informal squadron social functions in all black and a black trench coat. “This is not just in hindsight. He scared me at the time.” Even after he left the military, he contacted her on Facebook with disturbing posts about his obsession with Dylann S. Roof, the Charleston, S.C., mass murderer, and his target practices using dogs ordered online. Ms. Edwards said the military had tried counseling and tough love, but nothing seemed to work. When punished for poor performance, Mr. Kelley would cry, scream and shake with rage, vowing to kill his superiors, she recalled. His temper was so unsettling that she warned others in the squadron to go easy on him or he was likely to come back and “shoot up the place.” The Air Force, like the civilian world, is often ill-equipped to intervene before violence occurs. Though Mr. Kelley’s behavior raised flags, commanders say they have limited options until a crime is committed. Even then, the priority is more often on getting problem troops out of the military, giving little thought to the possible impact on society. After facing intense criticism for its failure to report Mr. Kelley, the Air Force has opened an investigation into the case and many questions remain about what more it could have done. For Mr. Kelley, the military was likely an encouraging option at first. His family had a tradition of going to Texas A&ampM University: His grandfather, father and both siblings became Aggies. But growing up in New Braunfels, Tex., Mr. Kelley did not get the grades to attend one of the state’s top schools. Besides earning mostly C’s, he had amassed at least seven suspensions for insubordination, profanity, dishonesty and drugs, according to school records. The Air Force offered him a clean slate and the chance to prove himself. He enlisted right after high school in 2009. Based on above-average aptitude test scores, he was picked to become a fusion analyst — an intelligence specialist trained to interpret and communicate the latest information on enemy tactics. It promised a clear career path and a top-secret clearance. In spring 2010, after two months of basic training, he arrived at Goodfellow Air Force Base near San Angelo, Tex., for the rigorous six-month intelligence technical school. Graduating required passing a polygraph test and a background check to get a security clearance. Mr. Kelley washed out before graduation. The Air Force did not provide details on whether Mr. Kelley passed the required polygraph, which typically scrutinizes mental health, drug use, family issues and disruptive behavior. A military official briefed on Mr. Kelley’s Air Force record said only that he was cut from the school for “academic reasons.” Several airmen who went through school with Mr. Kelley said in a closed Facebook group viewed by The New York Times that he did not last long. Some remembered him being there only a few weeks. “I didn’t even realize he was in for as long as he was,” one of them said. “I thought he was discharged in tech school, let alone retrained into a different career field.” Mr. Kelley’s next assignment was decidedly less demanding. Records show the Air Force made him a traffic management apprentice, a job that includes moving people and freight, and requires a minimal aptitude score. Still, he struggled. He was sent in 2011 to Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico and assigned to the 49th Logistics Readiness Squadron. Six days before he arrived, he had married 19-year-old Tessa Loge from his hometown — a move that allowed his new wife and her baby from another relationship to move into base housing with him, and gave him increased pay because he had dependents. At the base, Mr. Kelley worked in the receiving department, entering information on incoming supplies into a computer. He was smart enough, said Ms. Edwards, who worked in the same office, but he and his new wife fought constantly and were being investigated by local child protective services for child abuse. His wife, who later divorced him, declined to comment. Mr. Kelley was so emotionally unstable and unfocused, Ms. Edwards said, that he often would not do his work. As punishment, superiors would give Mr. Kelley menial tasks, such as mopping or scrubbing toilets, which would send him into a rage, Ms. Edwards said. “He would get so upset,” she said, “and just keep saying, ‘I want to kill them.’” He was formally disciplined multiple times, she said, including for sneaking a gun onto the base in his car. The Air Force confirmed that Ms. Edwards served in the same squadron as Mr. Kelley, and that evaluations show he performed poorly. The squadron wrote up the airman for every infraction, Ms. Edwards said, laying a paper trail that would allow the Air Force to discharge him for poor performance. Before it could do that, in April 2012, Mr. Kelley was arrested and detained after he pointed a gun at his wife, hitting and choking her, and hit his baby stepson, fracturing his skull. His wife filed for divorce that year. While Mr. Kelley awaited court-martial, the Air Force sent him to a civilian psychiatric hospital in Santa Teresa, N.M., where, according to local emergency dispatch records, he was given medication for depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and was considered a “high-risk patient.” On the night of June 7, 2012, Mr. Kelley escaped, made his way 12 miles south in the desert night to the El Paso bus station and bought a ticket home. His counselor at the hospital called the police, according to a police report, warning that Mr. Kelley had talked about killing his chain of command in the Air Force and told other patients he had recently bought guns online. Mr. Kelley was quickly caught and kept in pretrial confinement before his court-martial because his commanders were concerned about the threats, said Don Christensen, a retired colonel who at the time was the Air Force’s chief prosecutor. He pleaded guilty to two counts of assault and in November 2012 was sentenced to 12 months in confinement — a relatively light sentence. “A serious injury to a child is worth more than a year in confinement,” said Mr. Christensen, who is now president of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence in the military. Mr. Christensen said that during his military career he had seen service members receive the same punishment Mr. Kelley got for merely abusing over-the-counter cough medicine. The Air Force should have entered Mr. Kelley’s name into federal databases that bar convicted felons from buying firearms — but did not. That mistake allowed him to buy several guns over the next few years. Air Force officials apologized last week after admitting that in recent years an unknown number of violent criminals were never registered with the system. “We’re looking at all of our databases,” the Air Force secretary, Heather Wilson, said. After his guilty plea, Mr. Kelley served just eight months in military prison. In June 2013 he was let out, having been knocked down to the lowest possible rank and given a bad conduct discharge that barred him from nearly all veterans benefits, including mental health treatment. He went back to New Braunfels. Though his parents owned a sprawling ranch house with a patio and pool, he moved into their barn. He married again in 2014, to 19-year-old Danielle Shields. “That’s where things started to get weird,” said Ms. Edwards, who reconnected with Mr. Kelley around that time when he called asking for a job reference. They started chatting occasionally on Facebook, she said, and his posts grew gradually more disturbing until she finally stopped communicating with him this year. At first, Mr. Kelley shared photos of his children and small updates, she said. Then he started complaining about his new wife, and about how his family was trying to get him to take medication. He said he hated his wife, but feared she would leave and take the children, Ms. Edwards said. Law enforcement officials said their rocky relationship may have contributed to the shooting on Sunday. A friend of Mr. Kelley’s mother-in-law, Todd Feltner, said on Friday that the marriage was strained because “Devin was abusing her physically, verbally and mentally.” He added that the mother-in-law told him that Mr. Kelley had threatened her family, too: “He was telling her ‘that he was going to get them.’” Soon, Mr. Kelley’s Facebook conversations turned dark. He started sending Ms. Edwards photos of weapons he had bought and descriptions of killing animals. At first, she brushed it off as the enthusiasm of a hunter in the Texas hill country. But then, she said, he became obsessed with news of Mr. Roof, the 21-year-old who killed nine people in a church in South Carolina in 2015. “He was excited about it. He went on and on and on about it, saying ‘Isn’t it cool? Isn’t it cool?’ Have you watched the videos?’” Ms. Edwards said. She said she told Mr. Kelley that he was not acting normal and needed help. “He told me he would never have the nerve to kill people, he only killed animals,” she said. In 2016 he sent her photos of a new military-style rifle he was building, one that she said looked like the rifle the authorities said he used in the church shooting. This spring, Mr. Kelley’s comments became so disturbing that she unfriended him — something a number of his other friends also said they did. The breaking point came when he told her he was buying dogs online and using them as target practice. “I told him this was not normal, and he needed the kind of help I could not give him,” Ms. Edwards said. “Before I unfriended him, I gave him my number. I told him, ‘If you ever are thinking about hurting yourself or someone else, just call.’” He never called. Now she, like many others in his path, says she cannot help but blame herself for not acting when she saw signs of trouble. On Sunday, she was washing dishes at home when another member of their old squadron texted her. “The shooter, it’s Kelley,” the text said. She dropped the glass in her hands and started crying.\n",

      "The office of the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, has issued a “notice of violation” to Donald J. Trump’s foundation, ordering it to immediately stop soliciting charitable donations in the state. The letter, which was sent on Friday and released on Monday morning by Mr. Schneiderman’s office, said its charities bureau had determined that the Donald J. Trump Foundation had been fund-raising in New York this year when it was not registered to do so under state law. “The Trump Foundation must immediately cease soliciting contributions or engaging in any other fund-raising activities in New York,” wrote James Sheehan, the chief of the charities bureau. Mr. Trump’s foundation has come under increasing scrutiny amid questions about his fulfillment of large charitable pledges and his lack of financial support in recent years. The foundation’s compliance with the rules that govern nonprofit groups has also been a concern. The New York Times reported last month that Mr. Trump’s foundation does not show up on the charity registers in many states, and The Washington Post subsequently reported that the foundation did not have the certification necessary to solicit money in New York. “While we remain very concerned about the political motives behind A. G. Schneiderman’s investigation, the Trump Foundation nevertheless intends to cooperate fully with the investigation,” Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman, said in a statement on Monday. “Because this is an ongoing legal matter, the Trump Foundation will not comment further at this time.” Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has previously deflected criticism about his charitable giving, saying that he makes contributions personally and that he has been supportive of his foundation. Mr. Schneiderman’s office is investigating Mr. Trump’s foundation to determine if it is in compliance with state laws, including how it spends its money and courts donations. The attorney general’s office was particularly interested in a fund-raiser held by Mr. Trump this year to benefit veterans in lieu of attending a Republican primary debate. The event raised $5.6 million, including some money from wealthy donors, and the Trump Foundation said $1.67 million had come from online donations. The foundation did not break down the sources by state. Over the years, Mr. Trump has donated $5.4 million to his charity, according to the organization’s tax filings. But the last of those contributions was in 2008, and in recent years, the foundation’s coffers have been filled by outside donors — including organizations and people in New York. (The foundation’s most recently available filing was for 2014.) From 2009 to 2014, the foundation raised $4.36 million, with $2.5 million from New Yorkers, records show. State rules require nonprofits raising more than $25,000 a year in New York to register and file audited financial statements and annual financial reports to the attorney general’s charities bureau. In the letter, Mr. Schneiderman’s office provided notice to Mr. Trump’s foundation that it must provide those financial documents within 15 days. It also must file any “delinquent reports” for past years within that time frame. “The failure immediately to discontinue solicitation and to file information and reports” with the charities bureau, Mr. Sheehan said, “shall be deemed a fraud upon the people of the state of New York.” Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat and a supporter of Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, has also asserted in a separate pending case that Mr. Trump defrauded students who participated in Trump University, his for-profit educational program.\n",

      "SPEARFISH, S.D. — Shakespeare is alive and well in Spearfish! If any state knows the value of publicly financed art, it may be South Dakota: The council supports local artists and institutions with a mixture of state funds and money from the national endowment. The endowment sent the state $966,600 last year, most of which went to South Dakota’s arts council, which gets roughly half the money it disperses here from Washington. It joined other groups to create the Rolling Rez, which received a $100,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts this year.\n",

      "SPEARFISH, S.D. — The hand-printed sign on the door of the Matthews Opera House, a jewel box theater that anchors Main Street in this city of 11,000 in the northern Black Hills, proclaimed some surprising news this month about “Hamlet,” its first Shakespeare offering in two years. “Sold Out!” Inside, the first big cheer of the night came even before the ghost of Hamlet’s father appeared at Elsinore in Act I, when Sian Young, the theater’s executive director, thanked the National Endowment for the Arts for its support. “Shakespeare is alive and well in Spearfish!” Ms. Young told the audience, which included several families taking children to see their first “Hamlet.” South Dakota, a largely rural, politically red state that voted decisively for Donald J. Trump in November, is also a prime recipient of money from the very arts endowment that the president wants to eliminate. If any state knows the value of publicly financed art, it may be South Dakota: One of its biggest tourist attractions, Mount Rushmore, is, among other things, a colossal federally funded sculpture. People here have already grappled with the question of taxpayer support for the arts when South Dakota’s Republican-controlled state government considered  eliminating the state arts council in 2009 during the recession. The council supports local artists and institutions with a mixture of state funds and money from the national endowment. But after a public outcry, Republican officials decided to preserve the spending — by raising a tourism tax. Mostly rural states like South Dakota could have outsize importance in deciding the fate of the endowment — and of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which the president has also marked for elimination. South Dakota, which has fewer than a million people, received the fifth-highest amount of federal arts money per person in the nation last year, and the endowment’s generally small grants can have a bigger impact here than they would at the Metropolitan Operas of the world. The endowment sent the state $966,600 last year, most of which went to South Dakota’s arts council, which gets roughly half the money it disperses here from Washington. (Members of the state’s small congressional delegation did not respond to emails or calls seeking their position on the programs.) All told, Ms. Young said, the Matthews Opera House received around $30,000 through state arts grants last year. The money made up a sizable chunk of the roughly $350,000 annual budget for the theater, which is about 50 miles northwest of Rapid City. “I’ve got to be honest with you,” she said. “I don’t know that I can find $30,000” without the endowment. A few days in western South Dakota showed how a fragile arts scene has thrived recently with the aid of state and federal arts and humanities grants. Here are some postcards from the trip. The Matthews Opera House was built in 1906 by a rancher to welcome traveling companies. Portraits of Shakespeare and Edwin Booth, one of the great Shakespearean actors of the 19th century, loom above its small, ornate proscenium arch. Yet the theater’s fortunes waned over the years — it was used at times as a movie theater, a dance hall, a basketball court and even a shooting gallery. But in recent decades, it has been restored and turned into a vibrant theater that brings in visiting acts, hosts community theater groups and runs a children’s drama camp and outdoor festival each summer — with a staff of four, two of whom are full-time. With its “Hamlet,” performed by the National Players, a touring ensemble based in Maryland, Shakespeare was back onstage, under his portrait. Tickets ran $25 for adults and $10 for children. Robb Campbell, 48, a paralegal who lives nearby, attended with his family. “The 1980s rap against the N.E.A. was that it’s elitist — which is so dumb,” said Mr. Campbell, who has a subscription to the theater with his wife. “The rich can go see anything they want. But as much as the people here like this, I’m not sure they would see it if it cost $80.” It was the first live Shakespeare performance for his 12-year-old daughter, Ann, who offered her own review as she left the theater after the play’s high-body-count ending. “It was a little bit intense,” she said, “but I really liked it.” As the musicians of the Black Hills Symphony Orchestra warmed up in a rehearsal room at Central High School in Rapid City, Bruce Knowles, 59, who succeeded his father as music director nearly a decade ago, said he worried that losing the National Endowment would leave local groups competing with one another to try to make up the loss from the same small group of donors. “I can’t stress enough how thinly everybody here is stretched,” Mr. Knowles said in his office at the high school, where he directs the school’s well-regarded orchestra as well. The Black Hills Symphony has received $77,340 in state arts council grants during the past five years — money that has supported its concerts, which drew some 5,700 people last year, and school activities, which reached more than 2,000 students. Then there are the threatened public broadcasting cuts. The orchestra’s concert of Grieg’s “Symphonic Dances” and Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 was to be aired by South Dakota Public Broadcasting, an important way to reach audiences in a state with a spread-out population. It is the kind of local event — along with rodeos, high school sports and work by area artists — that might not be broadcast if the system loses federal support, which makes up more than a fifth of its budget. “The thing about it is, they call it an elitist thing,” Mr. Knowles said of the orchestra, which is more than 80 years old. “And you know, around here, it’s not. If it were to go away, you’d have to drive almost six hours to Sioux Falls, seven or eight hours to Denver, 12 to Minneapolis. Most people around here can’t afford to do that.” With his horses foaling, Tony Richards, 63, said that he would not have had time to make the hourlong drive from his corner of the sprawling Pine Ridge Reservation to the Heritage Center at Red Cloud Indian School to sell jewelry to its gift shop, which has emerged as an important supporter of the reservation’s Lakota artists. But last week, the gift shop came to him — on board Rolling Rez Arts, an airport shuttle bus that has been transformed into a mobile art classroom and credit union office. “Buying Art Today,” read a whiteboard outside the bus, which was parked in the community of Martin. Mr. Richards took a wooden jewelry case from his car and got on board. Carmen Little Iron, the gift shop’s manager, checked his tribal identification card to comply with federal laws governing the sale of native arts — his was from the Oglala Sioux — and bought several of his finely wrought bone chokers, beaded cross necklaces and earrings. “A lot of people don’t have vehicles, so this is good that they do it this way,” said Mr. Richards, who heard on KILI, the reservation’s radio station, that the buyers were coming to his district. “I’ve got 18 horses I take care of, and right now they’re foaling, so I have colts out there I’ve got to watch, because we’ve got mountain lions and coyotes. A lot of times I didn’t have time to go over there.” The idea for the Rolling Rez came from a recent study that found that more than half of native households on the reservation, one of the poorest parts of the nation, are engaged in a home-based business, and 79 percent of those produce some kind of art — but that most of the artists earned less than $10,000 a year and lacked cars, training and ways to meet buyers. “So we had a conversation about doing something on wheels — with access to markets and access to supplies,” said Lori Pourier, the president of First Peoples Fund, a group that supports indigenous artists. It joined other groups to create the Rolling Rez, which received a $100,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts this year. It offered more than 50 classes in art and entrepreneurship last year, mostly on Pine Ridge, but also on the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River reservations. The Dahl Arts Center, which was built in 1974 and given to the city by a prominent local banker, is famous for its 180-foot cyclorama telling the economic history of the United States. But the Dahl, managed by the Rapid City Arts Council, has transformed itself in recent years — undergoing a restoration and expansion that have made it a lively community hub. The center, which offers classes to preschoolers, teenagers and adults, drew some 35,000 visitors last year. Its current exhibitions range from an annual photography competition, to works by Native American artists exploring humor, to paintings by a local artist, Luke Gorder. Later this year it will present “Blake Little: Photographs From the Gay Rodeo” and “Black Hills Bounty,” which showcases work by local folk artists. The folk art show is entirely funded with state and national arts money, said Pepper Massey, executive director of the Rapid City Arts Council, which received $27,847 from the state arts council last year. “If that funding goes away, that might not have happened,” she said. One of the nation’s more unusual art spaces can be found off a dirt road in Spearfish, in a geodesic dome festooned with fantastical globes that their creator, the artist Dick Termes, has called “Termespheres.” They are essentially three-dimensional Escher-esque paintings on spheres, created with a technique he calls “six-point perspective.” “It’s really our salvation out here,” Mr. Termes, 75, said of the state grants, which have allowed him to remain in his home state and make a living as an artist. “Without it, I think we would have had to move.” His extensive work in the schools has made him a well-known figure here, and he recently made a 20-part online video series on drawing for South Dakota Public Broadcasting. His wife, Markie Scholz, who said that her state-supported puppet troupe had made it to all but 10 of South Dakota’s towns, said that the pushback the state encountered when it considered eliminating the arts council was inspiring. “We’re a very conservative state, and a very poor state, but they see the value of it,” she said. “The uproar was insane — just incredible.”\n",

      "How does a former senator ... stateswoman ... hoping to build a financial stockpile ... find a way to make it worth her donors’ while? “Hamilton” tickets. At a special Tuesday matinee, deep-pocketed supporters of Hillary Clinton filed into the Richard Rodgers Theater for a special performance that was, in a rare turn, a touch more expensive than a typical show. But with seats available for $2,700 — and status as “event chair” on offer for $100,000 — the gathering, held for the Hillary Victory Fund, did include an uncommon guest: Mrs. Clinton, who took the stage after the final bows of a show she has now seen three times. “I cry every time,” she said, after embracing the show’s creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, who left his role as the title character over the weekend but returned on Tuesday to introduce her. Mrs. Clinton, who first attended last year off Broadway, at the Public Theater, took care to establish her “Hamilton” bona fides, to a point. She neither rapped nor rhymed, but she alluded often to some of the show’s signature numbers. “As Washington tells us, history’s eyes are on us,” she said at one point, invoking “History Has Its Eyes On You.” “Let’s not throw away our shot,” she urged later, nodding to perhaps the show’s most famous song. The musical has become something of a bipartisan cause — “the only thing,” President Obama has joked, “that Dick Cheney and I agree on.” The president headlined a Democratic fund-raiser last year at the theater. Mr. Miranda has his own political roots: His father, Luis A. Miranda Jr., is a longtime Democratic strategist in New York. The younger Mr. Miranda has, in recent months, urged Congress to assist Puerto Rico in its financial crisis. In his remarks, Mr. Miranda, his once-long Hamiltonian mane now shorn, made clear his preference for the November election, criticizing Donald J. Trump without saying his name. “Are you going to vote for the guy who wants to build a wall or for someone who’s building bridges?” asked Mr. Miranda, whose Tony Award-winning show is, after all, about an immigrant. He observed that the show had featured, or at least alluded to, the first four presidents. “Right now,” he said, “you’re going to hear from the 45th president.” Mrs. Clinton, taking the stage to raucous cheers, hugged Mr. Miranda and thanked him for advocating on behalf of Puerto Rico and the families of victims of the massacre last month in Orlando. Speaking for about four minutes, Mrs. Clinton lingered on the message of the show’s final number, “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story,” and the meaning of legacy. “It really is true that it matters whose stories are told,” she said, “and heard.”\n",

      "Netflix and Marvel Television are conscientious about making sure the series they make together, good and bad, have distinct personalities. The latest, “Marvel’s The Punisher,” is the slow, quiet one, at least for a significant portion of its first season, which is available to stream on Friday. This iteration of Frank Castle, one of Marvel’s most brutal heroes, certainly has its moments of graphic, over-the-top violence. But in the early going, at least, they’re more widely spaced than you might expect for a comic-book story about a revenge-obsessed, gun-happy vigilante. To what extent that’s a prudent choice in light of the seemingly endless succession of mass shootings plaguing the country, and to what extent it’s a result of Netflix bloat — stretching a slender story to fill 13 episodes — is up for debate. The producers didn’t exercise much restraint with the show’s opening titles, a twirling ballet of multiplying automatic weapons. (A “Punisher” panel scheduled for the New York Comic-Con was canceled after the Las Vegas mass shooting.) In any case, it fits with a couple of other major choices made by the show’s creator, Steve Lightfoot, whose primary experience as a writer and producer was on another chilly, slow-moving show, “Hannibal.” He’s shifted the focus of the Punisher story away from violent street-level revenge and placed it on post-traumatic stress, one of the great American themes of our day. The very leisurely pace and sparsely populated long shots of the early episodes sometimes recall another PTSD story, “The Walking Dead.” He’s also skipped over the foundational Punisher story — ex-Marine goes on rampage, wiping out the mobsters, Irish gangsters and bikers he blames for the death of his wife and children — which already formed the backbone of the second season of the Netflix-Marvel “Daredevil.” It’s recapitulated in the first few minutes of “The Punisher,” after which, with some shaky continuity and timeline fuzziness, the show turns into a military conspiracy thriller. In its flashbacks to Castle’s time in Afghanistan, the show feels less akin to other Marvel series than to the fall’s spate of special-ops dramas. The slow boil and downcast vibe fit the skill set of its star, Jon Bernthal, who originated this version of the character in “Daredevil.” (Also crossing over is Deborah Ann Woll as the reporter Karen Page.) Mr. Bernthal does dour well, and he’s good at befuddled reactions and cloudy, churning anger. His expressive range doesn’t extend too far beyond that, but Castle doesn’t require much more. In the post-rampage narrative of “The Punisher,” Castle is trying to recover from double traumas: the destruction of his family, and the lingering guilt from his mission in Afghanistan. A support group for veterans figures prominently, and when Castle isn’t talking about “the things we did over there,” he’s having recurring nightmares about his wife’s death and sledgehammering walls at a construction site deep into the night, like a really depressed John Henry. The tropes of post-traumatic stress and recovery mesh with the topical elements of Mr. Lightfoot’s story, which are presented with more polish than nuance. Castle’s continuing struggle to decode his past — punctuated by those occasional eruptions of bone-crunching mayhem — plays out against a backdrop of enhanced interrogation, surveillance and the disaffection of embittered veterans, some of whom are eager to stage an insurrection to make America great again. The action picks up as the season progresses, but “The Punisher” never quite gets in touch with the visceral roots of its material, something that all of the other Netflix-Marvel series do, no matter how much they distance themselves from their comic-book sources. It’s handsomely shot (on New York City locations) and smoothly assembled, and its naturalistic, psychological, more moody than pulpy approach may work for non-comics fans who don’t mind some gore with their procedural thrillers. But if you want your Frank Castle to be a single-minded avenger, heed the words of one of his fellow construction workers: “He ain’t all there.”\n",

      "Lin-Manuel Miranda was on summer break from college when he learned something about how New York was put together. FRANCISCO MIRANDA enters. The neighborhood “was not in good shape,” Luis Miranda said. For Mr. Miranda, Inwood is still home, and subways are still part of his travel diet. “Hamilton is outlived by his foes, almost every one of which becomes president,” Mr. Miranda wrote in an email message. As Vonnegut put it, so it goes,” Mr. Miranda wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lin-Manuel Miranda was on summer break from college when he learned something about how New York was put together. He was working for a bilingual newspaper started by his father, covering an event called “Salsa, Blues and Shamrocks.” The event, put on by an Irish bar and restaurant in the Dominican neighborhood of Washington Heights, was somewhat misnamed — it featured klezmer and merengue music as well. For Mr. Miranda, then 20, it was a vision of New York’s disparate cultures not battling one another but jamming side by side. The institutions that endured, he realized, were those that “embraced every wave of immigration that’s come.” Within a few decades, this vision would inform the work that thrust him on the world. On a December morning in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Miranda, nursing a cold, reminisced about that summer, when he also discovered Morris-Jumel Mansion, the oldest house in New York, where Aaron Burr lived when he killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. During the school year, Mr. Miranda had written and staged his first musical, “In the Heights,” at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., and he had also moved into the Latino student house on campus, which gave him a new perspective on the layered worlds of New York and his own identity within them — part insider, part outsider looking in. Jumel Mansion, on Sugar Hill in Harlem, lay between Broadway and the two-story house in Inwood where Mr. Miranda grew up — with access to all those worlds but not bounded by any of them. “You’re in a different century for exactly one block, and then you go down the steps and there’s a C-town, and you’re back in 2017,” Mr. Miranda said. “That’s to me what makes New York great — it’s all these things together at the same time. The feeling that you’re on the train with the Wall Street guy and the mariachi bands. We’re all in this thing together.” At 37, Mr. Miranda can seem a fantasy of the Obama era, fulfilling the former president’s promise to “bridge the divide between Red and Blue America,” as Rolling Stone put it, and working the nation’s differences as assets rather than battle lines. “Hamilton,” a liberal romance about a conservative icon, invites audiences to play on multiple teams at once. Now, in a more fractious climate, Mr. Miranda is getting ready for his next act. Fittingly, that is a break from the stage. He and his wife, Vanessa Nadal, had their second child, Francisco, on Feb. 1, inspiring what USA Today declared “a perfect tweet”: “Int. Hospital Room. Night. [The screams reach a delirious crescendo. FRANCISCO MIRANDA enters. He is 7 pounds and 13 ounces.] Intermission.” “I’m really looking forward to not going into rehearsal the next day,” Mr. Miranda said in December. “Looking forward to camping out with my family, and hopefully starting some new writing projects. But at least for the first half of 2018 I’ll be home.” [line] Mr. Miranda’s journey through New York begins with that of his father, Luis A. Miranda, a political consultant who worked in Mayor Edward I. Koch’s administration and founded the nonprofit Hispanic Federation. The elder Mr. Miranda arrived in New York from Puerto Rico at age 18 with a college degree and limited English to attend graduate school at New York University. When he moved uptown to Inwood in 1981 after graduate school — he married a fellow student, Luz Towns, who is a clinical psychologist — the neighborhood “was not in good shape,” Luis Miranda said. “In fact, it was sort of the capital of murders in New York City. Crime was rampant. But we immediately fell in love with the neighborhood. It reminded me of my town in Puerto Rico, Vega Alta, where you get to know people and you get to know the small businesses around them.” Lin-Manuel, who was born in 1980, learned to juggle multiple identities early, spending his home life largely with the same nanny who had raised his father in Puerto Rico, and riding the yellow school bus to the elite Hunter College Elementary School on the Upper East Side. Inwood, for him, “was like a little Latin American country,” a playland of bodegas and a vast park, albeit one where he occasionally found stolen car parts. Downtown, he said, was where he was “the one who can speak Spanish to everyone’s nannies.” “I was code-switching between the two when I was 5 years old,” he said. “I’m Lin-Manuel at home and Lin at school. I remember going to see white Santa Claus at Macy’s and then seeing a darker Dominican Santa Claus on 176th Street at the community organization my parents volunteered at. That was my tale of two New Yorks.” At home, his father spoke to him in Spanish, his mother in English. The house was filled with politicians and relatives visiting from Puerto Rico, sometimes for long stretches. Even as a boy, “he navigated both worlds very easily,” the elder Mr. Miranda said. Lin-Manuel’s older sister, Luz, brought home hip-hop albums his father loved Broadway musicals, including “West Side Story,” which has been criticized for its largely stereotypical portrayals of Puerto Ricans. Lin-Manuel funneled both streams into the cassette tapes he swapped with friends. “I was fortunate to grow up at a time when your currency was how good a mixtape you could make,” he said. “You’d trade and it was, O.K., we’re friends now, we made each other a mixtape.” Making the tapes was his first training for writing Broadway musicals, he said. “It’s the best preparation,” he said. “I’m creating 90 minutes of material for you, I’m shaping the sound. It’s a rollercoaster of fast tempo, slow tempo. I can intercut bits of songs or comedy skits. I’m controlling the flow entirely, and you can’t skip tracks. I’m creating an experience for you of how I feel or how I want you to feel.” Summers he worked for his father, canvassing door-to-door for candidates or writing music for political ads. “Not jingles,” Lin-Manuel said. “But he’d say, ‘I need 30 seconds of Latin jazz for a Sharpton ad,’ or something for Elliot Spitzer,” the short-tenured governor of New York. One of his mixtape friends was Chris Hayes, who is now a host on MSNBC. Mr. Hayes rode the bus to Hunter from the Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale, and acted in plays with Mr. Miranda. Mr. Miranda rattled off songs from a mixtape Mr. Hayes gave him in ninth grade, all political songs, from Bob Dylan to the hip-hop group Digable Planets. Mr. Hayes said he and Mr. Miranda both saw themselves as less privileged than many of their classmates, and saw the bus ride uptown as a “literal manifestation” of their apartness. Years later, when Mr. Hayes saw a very early workshop of “Hamilton,” still unfinished, he was struck by the parallels between the title character and the creator, he said. “Seeing Hamilton was an immigrant, he lives uptown, he’s got this outer-borough-striver chip on his shoulder that Lin and I both had — like, I’m going to show these fancy people I belong — it felt so him,” Mr. Hayes said. For Mr. Miranda, Inwood is still home, and subways are still part of his travel diet. Last month he joined a successful campaign to save Coogan’s, the Washington Heights Irish bar that celebrated shamrocks and salsa. “Always happy to rep uptown,” he said. On this morning he was just back from London, where a production of “Hamilton” was starting, without him in the cast, and he was preparing to launch a toy drive for Puerto Rico. He has helped to raise more than $20 million for hurricane relief, and promised to bring “Hamilton” to Puerto Rico in 2019, with himself in the title role. “Since Hurricane Maria, that kind of became my full-time job for a couple months,” he said. Though many relatives have left the island, escaping either the hurricane or the economic collapse that preceded it, others were still there and without power, Luis Miranda said. His son’s advocacy for the island has drawn criticism from some Puerto Ricans, especially his 2016 support for an austerity debt relief bill called the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or Promesa. The law created a financial control board for the island that was not accountable to the local government, and lowered the minimum wage to $4.25 for young workers. Provisions in the law have hindered recovery efforts after Hurricane Maria. “I think his heart is in the right place,” said David Galarza Santa, a labor spokesman and community activist. “But it’s really difficult for me, because he became a poster child for this destructive law that would cause a lot of people to suffer. But seems like Maria slapped him back to reality.” Since the hurricane Mr. Miranda has argued for stronger supports for the island, without the austerity imposed by the Promesa. “The government and those bondholders need to treat this as a Hollywood studio,” he said. “The movie didn’t go – you made ‘Pluto Nash.’ They don’t have your money. There is not one organization on the island that has the money. Austerity didn’t work. They need to forgive the debt and move on.” Amid all this, he has starred in an upcoming film sequel to “Mary Poppins” and been a constant presence on Twitter, trading rap couplets with his two million followers and posting Spotify playlists, including a December compilation of instrumentals for students studying for final exams. His Twitter feed stands out as a relentlessly upbeat counterpoint to the grumbling that often fills the platform. “Given the political climate we’re in, globally, there’s a lot of terrible things going on, and social media has been a way to highlight that,” he said. “And that’s very good. But I’m also very aware of being a corner that’s capable of an occasional goofy joke or a video of my son singing a cute song. I appreciate when I see bright spots in my timeline, and I try to be that for other people. “This year I tried to take weekends off. I delete Twitter from my phone on weekends. The worst thing you can give me is an audience in my pocket. That’s not a good thing for a theater person.” But he has kept up a flow of “Hamilton”-related works, including monthly “Hamildrops” — free new songs or remixes posted to various streaming services. Last month’s was a tart hip-hop remix of the song “Wrote My Way Out,” from the 2016 “The Hamilton Mixtape” album. As for the changed political climate around “Hamilton,” Mr. Miranda said that was another theme explored in the show. The union that survives the title character at the show’s end is as fractious as the one that buys tickets today. And even in the current era, politicians do not express their differences with pistols. “Hamilton is outlived by his foes, almost every one of which becomes president,” Mr. Miranda wrote in an email message. “Jefferson, Madison, Monroe (with whom he almost got in a duel), John Quincy Adams. “We cannot control how the world reacts to our work. We can only control the work itself. So my show is embraced by one administration, not so much by the next.” History, after all, has room for both visions of America, and neither lasts forever. “As Vonnegut put it, so it goes,” Mr. Miranda wrote. “That’s time.”\n",

      "Title: Federal Judge Says Texas Voter ID Law Intentionally Discriminates - The New York Times\n",
      "\n",
      "HOUSTON — The judge, Nelva Gonzales Ramos of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, had made a similar ruling in 2014, but after Texas appealed her decision, a federal appellate court instructed her to review the issue once more. Some expected the ruling. Judge Ramos acknowledged the difficulty of pinning down the Legislature’s motives.

      "HOUSTON — A federal judge ruled on Monday that the voter identification law the Texas Legislature passed in 2011 was enacted with the intent to discriminate against black and Hispanic voters, raising the possibility that the state’s election procedures could be put back under federal oversight. In a long-running case over the legality of one of the toughest voter ID laws in the country, the judge found that the law violated the federal Voting Rights Act. The judge, Nelva Gonzales Ramos of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, had made a similar ruling in 2014, but after Texas appealed her decision, a federal appellate court instructed her to review the issue once more. The appeals court — the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans — found that Judge Ramos had relied too heavily on Texas’ history of discriminatory voting measures and other evidence it labeled “infirm” and asked her to reweigh the question of discriminatory intent. In her ruling on Monday, Judge Ramos wrote that the evidence cited by the Fifth Circuit “did not tip the scales” in favor of the state. Her ruling sets the stage for a potential penalty for Texas that could have a long-lasting impact. Lawyers involved in the case said the ruling effectively strikes down the law, although the judge did not issue a separate order doing so. Texas officials are likely to appeal the decision. “We’re disappointed and will seek review of this ruling at the appropriate time,” said Marc Rylander, a spokesman for the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton. Some expected the ruling. “This is an exciting ruling, but it is no surprise,” said Myrna Perez, a deputy director of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, which represented two of the groups that sued the state, the Texas N.A.A.C.P. and the Mexican-American Legislative Caucus. “Texas passed the most restrictive photo ID law in the country — a law the legislators knew would hurt minority voting rights, without any evidence justifying it, and they broke all sorts of legislative rules and norms to do it,” Ms. Perez said. Judge Ramos acknowledged the difficulty of pinning down the Legislature’s motives. She wrote of considering “all available direct and circumstantial evidence of intent” rather than trying to “discern the motivations of particular legislators.” The judge highlighted attempts by Democrats to blunt the racial impact of the law, known as Senate Bill 14, through amendments that were ultimately rejected, including allowing additional types of photo identification. “Many categories of acceptable photo IDs permitted by other states were omitted from the Texas bill,” she wrote. Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which represented some of the plaintiffs, said the ruling on Monday marked the fifth time that a court found that the law had a discriminatory purpose or effect. Judge Ramos’s decision, she said, “should sound the death knell for burdensome voter ID requirements in Texas and across the country.” For decades, Texas and several other mostly Southern states with a history of discrimination had been required to seek federal approval before making changes to their voting laws. But the states were freed from that requirement in 2013, after a Supreme Court decision that invalidated key provisions of the Voting Rights Act. The finding of intentional discrimination could once again put Texas under federal supervision. It would be the first state brought back into so-called preclearance since the Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling. Judge Ramos did not address whether she would order Texas to undergo federal oversight, but will examine the issue during the next stage of the case. The law was passed by the Legislature and signed by then-Gov. Rick Perry in 2011, but took effect in 2013. It required voters to show a driver’s license, passport or other government-issued photo ID before casting a ballot. It was previously found by the appellate court to have a discriminatory effect on black and Hispanic voters, many of whom lacked government-issued photo identification, and as a result was softened for the November 2016 election. Numerous Democratic lawmakers, voters, civil rights organizations and black and Hispanic groups sued, arguing that Republican legislators steamrollered the bill through the State House and Senate. They said legislators departed from procedural norms in passing the law, including classifying it as emergency legislation, cutting debate short and bypassing the ordinary committee process in both chambers. The plaintiffs told Judge Ramos in court documents and at various hearings that the law’s true purpose was to help Republicans maintain their hold on power amid the fast-paced growth of Democratic-leaning black and Hispanic voters. Republican officials, including Gov. Greg Abbott, who defended the law in court when he served as the state’s attorney general, have long disputed any suggestion that lawmakers intentionally discriminated. They said that the law was aimed at preventing voter fraud and that the departures from the normal legislative process were made to prevent Democratic lawmakers from manipulating procedural rules to thwart passage. They maintained that opponents had turned up no evidence that any legislator had intended to discriminate against blacks and Hispanics. Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department had joined the legal fight against Texas. But in a reversal that angered civil rights lawyers and Texas Democrats, the Trump administration’s Justice Department withdrew from the part of the case that Judge Ramos decided on Monday: the agency’s claim that Texas had enacted the law with discriminatory intent. Samuel Bagenstos, a law professor at the University of Michigan and a principal deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights in President Barack Obama’s Justice Department, noted the timing of the ruling. “I think it’s a very significant ruling in part because the Department of Justice under the Trump administration decided to abandon arguing for a discriminatory-intent holding,” Professor Bagenstos said. “This sort of makes the Department of Justice look bad for abandoning its previous position.” The ruling marked the third time this year that a federal court found, in separate cases, that Texas or one of its municipalities intentionally discriminated against minority voters. A judge ruled that officials in Pasadena, Tex., intentionally discriminated against Latino voters in redrawing the city electoral map. And a panel of judges in San Antonio ruled that the Legislature drew congressional districts in an intentionally discriminatory manner. The Republican lawmakers who passed the voter ID bill in 2011 also drew the discriminatory Congressional-district maps. “The State of Texas must turn away from this pattern of discriminatory behavior,” said Janai Nelson, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which represented an African-American voter affected by the voter ID law.\n",

Mobile readers can find “Dear Sugars” on the Podcasts app (iPhone and iPad) or Radio Public (Android and tablet). Dear Sugars, My 30-year-old daughter and her boyfriend have been living together for five years. They both have full-time jobs with good benefits. A few years ago, my daughter told me she wanted to marry and have a child before turning 30. I encouraged her to discuss this with her boyfriend. She did, and though she said he often talks about these things, no plans are in place. They’re now looking to buy a house. It’ll be a fixer-upper, since he’s insistent on living in a desirable section of their city — he’s the only child from a wealthy family and his mother will lend him the down payment. My fear is they’ll buy a project and my daughter’s wishes for marriage and children will once again be ignored. We live on the other side of the country, so we’re not privy to their daily lives, but my perception is that he calls the shots and my daughter goes along with his timetable. While he’s a seemingly sweet guy, he’s hyper-focused on his needs and wants. He spends a lot of money on himself and his hobbies. He buys my daughter expensive gifts, but often they’re things that will augment his interests. He’s funny, personable, and he treats our daughter well, but he’s manipulative in a hipster-nice-guy way. My husband thinks he’s selfish and immature, so I’m not alone in my ambivalence. Do I share my concerns with my daughter or stay out of it? I fear that no matter how gently I communicate my feelings, I’ll be stirring the pot, and that never ever ends well. What are the boundaries with adult children? Damned Either Way Steve Almond: One of the great things about Jane Austen is that she just keeps getting smarter. I thought of her novel “Emma” after reading your letter, DEW, and specifically how she describes her heroine: “With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of everybody’s feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange everybody’s destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken and she had not quite done nothing — for she had done mischief.” It’s important for you to heed Austen’s words. You want to help your daughter, not make mischief. That begins not in making assumptions about your daughter’s relationship, or proposing to arrange her destiny, but in trusting her to make her own decisions and defend her own interests. It’s fine to ask questions that will help you understand how she feels about her life. But the goal should be to listen and offer support, not direct her. Cheryl Strayed: You want your daughter to be happy, DEW. I understand that. But it might be helpful for you to acknowledge that it seems she is — even if she and her boyfriend aren’t moving forward on the marriage and motherhood timeline she previously stated she preferred. Perhaps she’s content with the way things are, perhaps she isn’t. There’s a way to explore these matters with your daughter without alienating her or demonizing her boyfriend. It’s in taking the middle path. Be inquisitive rather than disapproving sympathetic rather than judgmental. It’s important that you strike a supportive tone with your daughter for many reasons, but foremost is that she won’t trust you if she thinks you’re against her union with the man she loves. Every relationship has its challenges and those you report in your letter aren’t insurmountable. By your own description, your daughter’s boyfriend is basically a good guy. He’s certainly not the only 30-year-old hipster dude who’s a bit self-absorbed. Ask your daughter questions about the dynamics of their relationship and offer gentle feedback. Encourage her to assert her needs with her boyfriend, but let her figure it out on her own. It’s possible to give advice without telling people how to live their lives. SA: You ask what the boundaries are with adult children, but the truth is that every parent and child collaborate to define those boundaries. What we can say, with some assurance, is that children — of whatever age — know when they’re getting worked by a parent whose anxiety is expressing itself as control rather than concern. I’m not saying that’s the case here. But I’d think about the history of your relationship with your daughter, DEW. You’ve had many conversations with her over the years, about her feelings and her decisions. Look back at those and ask yourself: What was effective? When and how was I able to provide support and counsel in a way that helped my daughter? How does she define that boundary? CS: The question you ask about the role of parents in the lives of their adult children is an important one, DEW. Steve and I haven’t yet faced this conundrum directly because our kids are younger, but I know we’re both going to have opinions about their lives when they’re grown up — and not all of them will be positive. What I hope I’ll do when I disapprove of a choice one of my kids has made is to communicate to them that I’m on their side, even if I’m not thrilled with a particular decision. Their choices don’t always have to meet my approval. The best thing you can do is to stop seeing yourself as someone who should intervene in your daughter’s romantic life, DEW, but rather as the person who will support her and be there for her when she needs a sounding board as she navigates this relationship. SA: Right. It’s important to remember that your daughter is an adult. You have to trust her capacity to make wise decisions, and to survive her less wise ones. Just as crucially, you have to trust yourself and the work you’ve already done as a mom in helping your daughter develop the wherewithal to stand up for herself. Sometimes it’s hard to accept that the kids are all right, because it feels like you’re letting go of people who are precious to you. But recognizing your daughter’s independence isn’t the same as letting her go. You still get to love and support her. She’ll always need that from you.\n",

      "MEXICO CITY — Vicente Fox, the former president of Mexico, was recently stuck in Mexico City traffic, overcome with frustration — not by the congestion, but by something that was irritating him even more: Donald J. Trump. He grabbed his phone, turned the lens on himself and pressed record. “Ha! Donald,” Mr. Fox said, holding the phone perhaps a little too close to his face. “What about your apologies to Mexico, to Mexicans in the United States, to Mexicans in Mexico?” In short order, the 15-second clip was on Mr. Fox’s Twitter feed — another salvo in a personal campaign against the American presidential candidate that has included television appearances, radio interviews and a fusillade of hectoring Twitter posts. Mr. Fox’s voice is among a growing, if uncoordinated, chorus of influential Mexicans worried about what a Trump victory could mean for the complex relationship between the United States and Mexico — not to mention the impact Mr. Trump’s presidential bid may have already had. The voices have included at least two former Mexican presidents, top government officials, political analysts, academics, editorial writers and cultural figures. President Enrique Peña Nieto likened the candidate’s language to that of Hitler and Mussolini in an interview with Mexico’s Excelsior newspaper. And he recently shuffled his diplomatic corps in the United States, replacing Mexico’s ambassador to Washington and installing new consuls general around the country, in part to strengthen his administration’s response to the rise of Mr. Trump and what it reflects about American sentiment toward Mexico. While many leaders around the world are worried about how Mr. Trump’s campaign, win or lose, could shape American foreign policy, the concerns are particularly pointed in Mexico and throughout the Mexican diaspora because of the exceptionally close geographic, economic, demographic and cultural ties between the two countries. The two countries are now enjoying one of the more harmonious periods in a turbulent history. But many in Mexico fear that the friendship would rupture should Mr. Trump win the election and follow through on his threats to undo the North American Free Trade Agreement, force Mexico to pay for the construction of a wall between the countries by interrupting remittances and deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, about half of whom are Mexican. “His threat is cataclysmic, I think, for Mexico,” Enrique Krauze, a Mexican historian and literary magazine editor, said in an interview. “What it would mean for bilateral trade, in social terms, in the tearing of families, in the trauma, the collective panic, the opening of old wounds.” He added: “I can use one of Trump’s favorite words. Yes, this is huge. It’s a huge danger.” Mexican critics of Mr. Trump say he has already damaged the image of their country and of the Mexican people with his espousal of views that many regard as xenophobic. At a rally to kick off his campaign in June, the Republican candidate suggested that many Mexican immigrants were drug traffickers and rapists. Mexican officials, concerned about negative impressions of Mexico in the United States, have been rolling out a strategy to improve the image of their country and show how the relationship between the two nations has been of “mutual benefit,” said Paulo Carreño, the newly appointed under secretary for North America in Mexico’s Foreign Ministry. The strategy includes “cultural diplomacy,” grass-roots activism and the deployment of Mexican community and business leaders living in the United States, he said. As part of the strategy, the Peña Nieto administration shook up its diplomatic corps in the United States last month: The Mexican ambassador to Washington, Miguel Basáñez Ebergenyi, who had been in the job less than a year, was abruptly replaced by Carlos Sada Solana, a veteran diplomat. In addition, 26 consulates changed leadership. A statement from the Foreign Ministry announcing Mr. Sada’s appointment emphasized his experience “protecting the rights of Mexicans in North America, as well as defending the interests of Mexican abroad.” In addition, a few high-level government officials have reacted publicly to Mr. Trump, including Humberto Roque Villanueva, the Interior Ministry’s under secretary for population, migration and migratory affairs. He told the newspaper El Universal this month that the Mexican government was analyzing “how to confront what we would call the Trump emergency.” “I believe Mr. Trump speaks off the top of his head and doesn’t have a clear idea about financial matters or international accords,” he added. “We live in a globalized world. The United States would have to return to a kind of Middle Ages to prohibit remittances or charge tariffs that aren’t charged in other parts of the world.” In general, however, the administration has mostly refrained from commenting on the candidate. That has frustrated many Mexicans, who have called on the government to come to the defense of Mexico and push back at Mr. Trump more forcefully. “They can package that in the traditional Mexican nonsense: We don’t interfere in elections,” said Jorge Castañeda, a former foreign minister. “The real reason is that they have no idea what to do, so the default option is to do nothing.” Instead, most of the Mexican agitation against Mr. Trump has come from the general public. At the beginning of his campaign, many Mexicans viewed Mr. Trump with a mixture of alarm and amusement. But the amusement has mostly fallen away. “Why should we worry?” Mr. Krauze asked, rhetorically. “I couldn’t think of a reason not to worry, no?” In the fall, Mr. Krauze and Carmelo Mesa-Lago, an emeritus professor of economics and Latin American studies at the University of Pittsburgh, drafted a letter denouncing Mr. Trump’s campaign. Sixty-seven prominent Latinos — academics, scientists, writers and filmmakers in the United States, Spain and Latin America — signed it. “His hate speech appeals to lower passions like xenophobia, machismo, political intolerance and religious dogmatism,” the letter said. In recent months, Mr. Castañeda has been pushing a pro-Mexico social media campaign with the hashtag #ImProudToBeMexican. Aiming at an American, English-speaking audience, he has uploaded videos to Facebook and a campaign website extolling the diversity of the Mexican diaspora and its contributions to the United States. Explaining the American focus of this lobby, he said: “I don’t want to convince Mexicans how nasty Trump is, because everyone knows that. That’s a done deal.” Mr. Fox’s drumbeat of harangues against Mr. Trump began in February when he declared in a television interview, using a forceful expletive, that Mexicans would not build the candidate’s proposed wall. He escalated from there, chiding Mr. Trump with language that sometimes devolved into schoolyard churlishness. He called the candidate “a false prophet,” “dictator” and “loser.” He posted a selfie taken against the backdrop of a beach with this message: “Trump, this beautiful Cancun. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE.” He posted photos from his wife’s birthday party, taunting Mr. Trump: “What do you know about love? Or you just know about hating. How sad!” This month, Mr. Fox expressed contrition for some of his comments in an interview with Breitbart News and apologized to Mr. Trump. But amid blowback from Mexicans on social media and elsewhere who accused him of weakness, he resumed his badgering, posting photos on social media of a Trump-brand tie made in China and a Trump-brand jacket made in Mexico — evidence, he said, of the candidate’s hypocrisy. Mr. Fox said in a telephone interview from his home in Guanajuato State that he was motivated to attack Mr. Trump by what he called “pure love for that great nation, the United States.” “I don’t understand why the American public is buying this,” he continued, pain in his voice. “We are partners, we are neighbors, and we should be friends. He’s dividing not only American society, but he’s dividing two nations. “Why does he pick on Mexico?”\n",

      "When it comes to curb appeal, I’m usually all in. By the first warm days of spring, my stoop is awash with planters brimming with begonias, marigolds and petunias. In the fall, out come the mums and the pumpkins. But by the time December rolls around, I am done. I just don’t have it in me to climb a ladder and do battle with an uncooperative string of Christmas lights. So, when we drove onto my street after a long Thanksgiving weekend away, I braced myself for the inevitable. Every neighborhood has one: The Perfect Holiday House. Not 48 hours after the turkey has been carved, the lights are strung, the wreath is hung and garlands wrap the windows. The one on my block is a midcentury ranch-style house, which currently has a glowing reindeer suspended in mid-frolic on the lawn. The powder-blue front door looks like a present just begging to be opened. My own door has no such holiday spirit. As we pulled into our driveway that evening last month, my daughter whined from the back seat: “Why can’t we have lights?” We can’t have lights because Mommy can’t be bothered, I thought to myself. But is that really what this is all about? Maybe it has more to do with the fear of being that other house. You know the one, with a sad string of partly functional multicolored bulbs limply dangling from the hedges. Those lights are invariably the last to go up, and the last to come down, drooping over the boxwood until sometime in the middle of February because the only thing worse than dousing your property with a tangled web of electrical cords is having to take it down. When it comes to holiday décor, there are definitely two camps. “One is a camp of fabulous, benevolent, generous people who put all this effort into entertaining the rest of us,” said Simon Doonan, the creative ambassador for Barneys New York who will be a judge on “Making It,” a coming NBC show hosted by Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman about crafting. “You’re either that person or you’re not.” And if you’re not, then you likely fall into Camp No. 2. Somehow, I have a sinking feeling that these are my people. Here, you find “people who don’t know how to go about it,” Mr. Doonan said. “It’s a combination of lacking the motivation and not knowing where to begin.” Curious about the breed of benevolent, generous decorators, I decided to check on the neighbor with the festive house, Aggie Zelazko, a school psychologist. She was breathless, standing beside an array of nutcrackers and decorative Santas as she finished hanging ornaments on her tree. Just looking at her living room, cluttered with stacks of red and green plastic bins, was exhausting. But she didn’t seem to mind. “I love it. I just love it. It makes me feel warm and happy,” she said. “I even got the reindeer antlers on my car.” The car? I hadn’t even considered the car. I admired the enthusiasm. I might lack it, but I could have goals. Maybe I could start small — I’m not trying to keep up with the houses in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, here. I’m just hoping to rival an ordinary well-decorated one. I wondered if, with nominal effort, our house could get into the holiday spirit, festooned with something more than a cursory wreath. I have typically dismissed the idea of Christmas décor because I’m Jewish. But my husband is not and we do celebrate Christmas, so maybe I could give it a whirl. Watch a few minutes of a Lowe’s how-to video and you can’t help but feel inspired. The homeowner in a plaid work shirt looks so happy sizing up his arts and crafts style house in the video set to jolly music with a cheerful voice-over. How hard could this be? But when he pulls out a clipboard, pencil and measuring tape, I begin to suspect that those homeowners up on ladders are just putting a happy face on an otherwise grinding chore. Michael Fanelli, an electrician who lives in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., with his wife and their two children, doesn’t even bother with the happy face. “I do it with a frowning face,” he said. Mr. Fanelli normally enjoys fussing with the outside, describing himself as an avid gardener. “My landscaping is bar none,” he said of his yard, where he grows fig trees, dahlias and roses. “I have this beautiful landscaping and then I’m putting this cheap, plastic garbage on it.” Of course, if you don’t want to clip wires to the gutters, you could just plunk a projector on the lawn and spray your house with dancing stars for around $30. But that just feels like cheating. And you’re not fooling anyone — we all know you had very little to do with those twinkling candy canes floating across your siding. To do it right is not cheap. Installing holiday lighting on a house in this country costs, on average, about $386, according to HomeAdvisor. But you could easily spend much more. A five-foot-tall faux lit berry tree from Pottery Barn will set you back $199. By the first week of December, a pre-lit deer and sleigh was on sale at Pier One Imports for $438 (down from an eye-popping $730). Ms. Zelazko said she spent around $750 on outdoor decorations to cover her three-bedroom house. The red bows in the windows cost $32 a piece and “those light-up Rudolphs are pricey,” she added. Hire someone to do the job for you (there is a service for everything) and expect to spend even more. George Apap, a house painter and the owner of a Shine Holiday Lighting franchise in Patterson, N.Y., said his professional decorating service costs, on average, $2,000 for a two-story house. The price includes materials, installation, removal and storage. His priciest residential installations cost around $5,000. “Most people want a custom design,” Mr. Apap said. “They need direction because people just don’t know what to do.” You could always channel your inner crafter, instead. Mr. Doonan suggested repurposing copper pot-scrubbers, of all things. “You could make yourself a wreath for your front door and people say, ‘Look how clever! You’ve made a wreath!’” But somehow, Brillo pads and fairy lights don’t cut it for me. What I do like to see outside are plants. So, rather than trek to the Christmas Tree Shops, I paid a visit to the local garden center, where I picked up a wreath made of fresh-cut pine for the front door. And for the stoop I bought some potted spruce saplings with decorative bells hanging on the branches and holly in shiny red planters wrapped in ribbon.

      "For centuries, skin color has held powerful social meaning — a defining characteristic of race, and a starting point for racism. “If you ask somebody on the street, ‘What are the main differences between races?,’ they’re going to say skin color,” said Sarah A. Tishkoff, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania. On Thursday, Dr. Tishkoff and her colleagues showed this to be a profound error. In the journal Science, the researchers published the first large-scale study of the genetics of skin color in Africans. The researchers pinpointed eight genetic variants in four narrow regions of the human genome that strongly influence pigmentation — some making skin darker, and others making it lighter. These genes are shared across the globe, it turns out one of them, for example, lightens skin in both Europeans and hunter-gatherers in Botswana. The gene variants were present in humanity’s distant ancestors, even before our species evolved in Africa 300,000 years ago. The widespread distribution of these genes and their persistence over millenniums show that the old color lines are essentially meaningless, the scientists said. The research “dispels a biological concept of race,” Dr. Tishkoff said. Humans develop color much as other mammals do. Special cells in the skin contain pouches, called melanosomes, packed with pigment molecules. The more pigment, the darker the skin. Skin color also varies with the kind of pigments: Melanosomes may contain mixtures of a brown-black called eumelanin and a yellow-red called pheomelanin. To find the genes that help produce pigments, scientists began by studying people of European ancestry and found that mutations to a gene called SLC24A5 caused cells to make less pigment, leading to paler skin. Unsurprisingly, almost all Europeans have this variant. “We knew quite a lot about why people have pale skin if they had European ancestry,” said Nicholas G. Crawford, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the new study. “But there was very little known about why people have dark skin.” Since the early 2000s, Dr. Tishkoff has studied genes in Africa, discovering variants important to everything from resistance to malaria to height. African populations vary tremendously in skin color, and Dr. Tishkoff reasoned that powerful genetic variants must be responsible. Studying 1,570 people in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Botswana, she and her colleagues discovered a set of genetic variants that account for 29 percent of the variation in skin color. (The remaining variation seems tied to genes yet to be discovered.) One variant, MFSD12, was particularly mysterious: No one knew what it did anywhere in the body. To investigate its function, the researchers altered the gene in reddish lab mice. Giving them the variant found in darker-skinned Africans turned the mice gray. As it turned out, MFSD12 can affect the production of brown-black eumelanin, producing a darker skin color. The eight gene variants that Dr. Tishkoff and her colleagues discovered in Africans turned out to be present in many populations outside the continent. By comparing the DNA of these people, the researchers were able to estimate how long ago the genes appeared. They turned out to be immensely old. A variant for light skin — found in both Europeans and the San hunter-gatherers of Botswana — arose roughly 900,000 years ago, for example. Even before there were Homo sapiens, then, our distant forebears had a mix of genes for light and dark skin. Some populations may have been dark-skinned and others light-skinned or maybe they were all the same color, produced by a blend of variants. Neanderthals split off from our own ancestors an estimated 600,000 years ago, spreading across Europe and eastern Asia. While they became extinct about 40,000 years ago, some of their DNA has survived. These hominins inherited the same combination of variants determining skin color, Dr. Tishkoff and her colleagues also discovered. It’s possible that some populations of Neanderthals, too, were light-skinned, and others dark-skinned. Living humans come packaged in a wide range of hues — from pale and freckly in Ireland to dark brown in southern India, Australia and New Guinea. Researchers have argued that these varying colors evolved partly in response to sunlight. The idea is that people who live with intense ultraviolet light benefited from dark color, pigments that shielded important molecules in their skin. In places with less sunlight, people needed lighter skin, because they were able to absorb more sunlight to make vitamin D. The new genetic evidence supports this explanation, but adds unexpected complexity. The dark-skinned people of southern India, Australia and New Guinea, for example, did not independently evolve their color simply because evolution favored it. They inherited the ancestral dark variants Dr. Tishkoff’s team found in Africans. “They had to be introduced from an African population,” said Dr. Tishkoff. Yet the same is true for some genes that produce light skin in Asia and Europe. They also originated in Africa and were carried from the continent by migrants. As Africans moved into Europe and Asia, they interbred with Neanderthals on several occasions. Last week, Michael Dannemann and Janet Kelso of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany reported that people in Britain still carry a number of Neanderthal variants that color skin. Some of the newly discovered genes appeared relatively recently in our evolution. The pale-skin variant of SLC24A5 that’s overwhelmingly common in Europe, for example, is a recent addition to the genome, arising just 29,000 years ago, according to the new study. It became widespread only in the past few thousand years. Dr. Tishkoff and her colleagues found it frequently not just in Europe, but also in some populations of lighter-skinned Africans in East Africa and Tanzania. Studies of ancient DNA recently discovered in Africa point to an explanation. Several thousand years ago, it seems, a migration of early Near Eastern farmers swept into East Africa. Over many generations of interbreeding, the pale variant of SLC24A5 became common in some African populations. In all, the new study provides “a deeper appreciation of the genetic palette that has been mixed and matched through evolution,” said Nina Jablonski, an expert on skin color at Pennsylvania State University.\n",

      "For wary Washington journalists, it seemed only a matter of time before Donald J. Trump’s presidency would lead to a high-tension standoff between his administration and the news media. But on Day 1? The news media world found itself in a state of shock on Sunday, a day after Mr. Trump declared himself in “a running war with the media” and the president’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, used his first appearance on the White House podium to deliver a fiery jeremiad against the press. Worse, many journalists said, were the falsehoods that sprang from the lips of both Mr. Trump and Mr. Spicer on Saturday. Mr. Trump accused the news media of confecting a battle between himself and the intelligence services (in fact, he had previously compared the services to Nazi Germany in a Twitter post). And among other easily debunked assertions, Mr. Spicer falsely claimed that Mr. Trump’s inauguration was the most attended in history (photographs indicated it was not). “It was absolutely surprising and stunning,” the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, Jeff Mason, said on CNN on Sunday. In a phone interview later, Mr. Mason said: “People were surprised. I was surprised. It’s not what I was expecting for the first statement by the press secretary in the press room.” The tensions flared anew on Sunday when Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump’s top advisers, said in a television interview that Mr. Spicer had merely presented “alternative facts” about the inauguration, prompting an astonished response from her questioner, Chuck Todd of NBC. “Wait a minute — ‘alternative facts’?” Mr. Todd asked Ms. Conway on “Meet the Press.” “Look, alternative facts are not facts. They’re falsehoods.” When Mr. Todd pressed her about why the administration had put Mr. Spicer behind the lectern for the first time to “utter a provable falsehood,” Ms. Conway responded with a sharp threat. “If we’re going to keep referring to our press secretary in those types of terms, I think that we’re going to have to rethink our relationship here,” she said. Video of Ms. Conway’s evasion quickly spread on social media. The phrases “alternative facts” and “#alternativefacts” had been used on Twitter more than 380,000 times by midafternoon on Sunday, a Twitter spokesman said. Also by Sunday afternoon, there were scattered calls for the White House press corps to boycott Mr. Spicer’s briefings, although such a drastic response appeared unlikely. Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed, said on Sunday that the briefings were “a useful, if not essential, tradition” and that his outlet would keep a reporter there. Mr. Smith added that the Trump administration would “find practical reasons to be honest.” “In particular,” Mr. Smith wrote in an email, “I think they’ll find in moments of real crisis, rather than political theater, that they need to win back the credibility that they are spending now.” Mr. Mason, the correspondents’ association president, who is the chief liaison between the White House press corps and Mr. Spicer, said his goal was to maintain a constructive relationship. “It’s up to him and up to the president to decide how they want to get started,” Mr. Mason said of Mr. Spicer. “And that’s what they decided.” Some reporters and commentators noted that hostility between White House press operations and the news media was nothing new. Jack Shafer, the acerbic media critic, wrote on Twitter that “the press is supposed to be abused, disparaged, defamed, dissed.” He added, “It’s part of the job.” Lynn Sweet, a political reporter for The Chicago Sun-Times, said credibility, not civility, was what mattered. “If Sean wants to have an angry tone, frankly, I don’t care,” Ms. Sweet said on CNN. “I don’t care if you vent.” She added: “I care if he says something that’s true. I care if he gives us facts.” In an interview on Sunday, Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under George W. Bush, said that Mr. Spicer’s statements on Saturday were somewhat typical of the spin at press briefings. But Mr. Spicer’s “eagerness and willingness” to confront the press corps so directly represented a break from tradition, Mr. Fleischer said. “Everybody complains about the press, but most people bite their tongue” in news conferences, Mr. Fleischer said. Mr. Fleischer added that Mr. Spicer’s remarks could hurt his credibility unless he backed them up — or at least addressed them — during the first official White House briefing on Monday. “Sean’s first client is the president of the United States and those around the president his second client is the press corps,” Mr. Fleischer said. “And he has to serve both, always guided by the truth.” In reporting on the day’s events, many news organizations also called out the falsehoods that Mr. Trump and Mr. Spicer offered on Saturday, using variations of “false,” “falsehoods” and “lies” in headlines and stories. Breitbart News, the right-wing website that has embraced Mr. Trump, was more credulous in its headline: “WH Press Secretary Sean Spicer Blasts Media’s ‘Deliberately False Reporting.’” Voice of America, the government-funded news operation that broadcasts American journalism beyond the country’s borders, pointed out Mr. Spicer’s inaccuracies and ran an article from The Associated Press fact-checking his remarks. Still, that came only after the organization initially posted a string of Twitter messages that quoted Mr. Spicer without context, prompting questions about whether it was endorsing his comments. Voice of America’s director, Amanda Bennett, said that there had been no instructions or interference from the Trump administration and that Voice of America had quickly decided it needed to provide more explanation. “Internally, there was like an explosion of direct messages saying you’ve got to do something about this,” Ms. Bennett said in an interview on Sunday. That led to a course correction on Twitter, including the deletion of one tweet that appeared to support Mr. Spicer. For First Amendment advocates, the events of Mr. Trump’s first 48 hours in office were, to say the least, unsettling. In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union denounced Mr. Spicer’s remarks as “possible government censorship” and vowed that any threats by Mr. Trump’s administration to the principles of freedom of the press would be met with a “vigorous defense” of the First Amendment. “If Trump wants to take on the First Amendment,” the group said in the statement, “we will see him in court.”\n",

      "Good morning. Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the  stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state). California Today will also rely on, and amplify, your voices. Tell us about the issues that matter to you — and what you’d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes.com.  Want to receive California Today by email? Sign up. Let’s get to it. I just moved back to California after a long exile on the East Coast. I’m a third-generation Californian — born outside Sacramento, where lawmakers come and go, and raised in San Juan Capistrano, where swallows do the same. I wanted to dive right in. So I’ve been asking as many people as possible: What should California Today be paying attention to? Five answers that stood out: • We hear a lot, rightly, about drought and wildfires, but Californians should also be alarmed about another threat, said Steven Hackett, a Humboldt State economist who has focused on natural resources. The Pacific has been soaking up enormous amounts of carbon dioxide from human emissions, a process known as ocean acidification. Professor Hackett said, if left unchecked, it could set off “tremendous cascading effects,” devastating California’s marine ecosystems. “There are a lot of questions about, ‘What can we do about that?’” he said. • Specialists see no end in sight to California’s housing shortage, which promises to worsen homelessness and fights over gentrification. Lateefah Simon, a Bay Area activist, said we should be talking more about another of its effects: the punishing commutes that working-class people face as they are priced out of urban centers. With spotty public transportation, and rising fares, they endure hourslong trips into San Francisco and other cities. “Infrastructure is not a sexy thing for young millennials. It’s not something you talk about everyday,” said Ms. Simon, who is running for a seat on BART’s board of directors. “We need to change that.” • Carson Bruno, a fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, warned that unless a solution appears to the housing crisis, which he blamed in part on the misuse of environmental law, Bay Area businesses would begin to flee the state. “California faces a lot of challenges,” he said. “But this one has the potential to eliminate the California dream entirely.” • Camille Rose Garcia, an artist in Northern California, talked about a shake-up of the gallery scenes of San Francisco and Los Angeles. The spread of digital culture has led to “a circumventing of the galleries that is making some of them irrelevant,” Ms. Garcia said. The shift can be empowering for artists, especially younger ones, who increasingly connect with buyers directly online and through social media. “There is no more of the gallery holding the golden key to the kingdom,” she said. • Finally, Mona Field, a political scientist in Los Angeles, talked about another shake-up, this one on the near horizon. Californians are facing a November ballot with, count them, 17 measures. To name a couple: marijuana legalization and the repeal of the death penalty. “It’s preposterous that they are all on one ballot,” she said, suggesting that California Today do a series that analyzes each proposition. Challenge accepted, Ms. Field. (Stay tuned.) • “Amazing,” “must-read,” “riveting.” That’s how readers are reacting to “Framed,” a six-part true crime saga involving a PTA mother in Irvine. [Los Angeles Times] • In reliably Democratic California, the action through Election Day is going to be in the voter initiatives, not the presidential race. Analysts expect close to $100 million in ad spending, writes Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief. [The New York Times] • President Obama on Monday waded into the debate over Colin Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the national anthem. He said he did not doubt the sincerity of the 49ers quarterback’s protest. [The New York Times] • Santa Ana is on edge over its booming homeless population. One encampment has spread out along the dry bed of the Santa Ana River. A student journalist captured intimate photos of life in “Skid River.” [Voice of OC] • Among the Silicon Valley elite, meanwhile, so few homes are on the market that buyers are getting more aggressive in approaching owners who haven’t officially decided to sell. [The New York Times] • How do Uber drivers decide when to call it a day? Many newer ones do the opposite of what economic rationality would seem to dictate. [The New York Times] • Hugh O’Brian, who played a quick-drawing peace officer on “The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp” from 1955 to 1961, died in Beverly Hills on Monday. He was 91. [The New York Times] • Vin Scully, the Dodgers’ broadcasting great, will call his last game on Oct. 2. Richard Sandomir, a Times columnist, said it would be a shame if TBS does not give him a national audience. [The New York Times] • Workers have installed the final piece of the spire atop the Wilshire Grand in downtown Los Angeles, making it the tallest skyscraper west of the Mississippi River. [Los Angeles Times] • Burning Man, the yearly carnival of self-expression in the Nevada desert, wrapped up over the weekend. Jim Urquhart, a Reuters photographer, caught the pageantry. [The Atlantic] Craig Claiborne at The New York Times invented the modern restaurant review. Since 1963 the newspaper’s reviews have been confined to the New York region. Now, Pete Wells is taking The Times’s starred review on the road, visiting Cassia, an Asian restaurant in Santa Monica. Even after a wary moment with gnarled pig tail, Mr. Wells praised the chef’s skill in creating big flavors without resorting to extremes. • On Wednesday, Apple will hold its annual fall event in San Francisco. It’s expected to unveil its next iPhone. Are they going to ditch the headphone jack? • The 1995 crime drama “Heat” had three big stars, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro — and Los Angeles. All will be on hand Wednesday night when the Academy screens an ultra high-definition restoration in Beverly Hills. A Q. and A. will follow. • With the potential for a huge new market in California, marijuana entrepreneurs will gather to talk business Wednesday through Friday at the Cannabis World Congress and Business Exposition in Los Angeles. • The San Francisco Fringe Festival kicks off Friday. The theater world’s answer to the bar crawl, the festival will present 38 shows over 16 days. • Fall is coming, folks. The Lake Tahoe Autumn Food and Wine Festival will greet the season beginning Friday and culminating with a wine contest on Sunday. There will be cooking demonstrations, mixology courses and a kids’ zone. When I told Kevin Starr, one of the state’s pre-eminent historians, about the California newsletter, he kindly offered to share his contacts. Then came an admonition. “Please also pay attention not just to where California screwed up, but on things that are going well here,” he said. “Somebody has to explain why we are the sixth largest G.N.P. on the planet.” Asked if he could explain it, he laughed. “Because of the interaction of all sort of things,” he said, “a talented population, in-migration of very educated people, the ascendancy of the entertainment business, the ascendancy of the digital business ...” He went on to mention biotech, agriculture and California’s role as an arbiter of good design. James Canton, a futurist in San Francisco, described California as the nation’s engine of innovation. We face serious problems. But, he said, there’s no better population to tackle them. “Californians are constantly inventing the future,” he said. “And that future inevitably translates into jobs and wealth creation and opportunity, particularly for immigrants.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

      "At the beginning of “The Salesman,” Emad (Shahab Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti) must evacuate their Tehran apartment. There are cracks in the walls, and the high-rise building is in danger of collapsing. That flawed edifice might stand as a kind of inverse metaphor for the film itself, which is a marvel of meticulous construction. With exquisite patience and attention to detail, Asghar Farhadi, the writer and director, builds a solid and suspenseful plot out of ordinary incidents, and packs it with rich and resonant ideas. Admirers of his earlier films — including “About Elly,” “The Past” and “A Separation,” a foreign-language Oscar winner in 2012 — will not be surprised. Mr. Farhadi has distinguished himself in his generation of Iranian filmmakers as an astute psychological realist and a fastidious storyteller. Although his films take place in a thoroughly modern, urban environment, there is something satisfyingly old-fashioned about his approach to contemporary life, an understated belief in the ethical value of addressing the complexities of experience through the clarity and subtlety of narrative art. [See where to stream Asghar Farhadi’s dramas at Watching, The New York Times’s film and TV recommendation site.] Rana and Emad, a childless married couple who look to be in their mid-30s, are both actors, members of a theater company engaged in a production of Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman.” Onstage, they play the Lomans, Willy and Linda, whose lower-middle-class American world is made to look both familiar and exotic. Some of the play’s sexual frankness has been blunted by Iranian government censors — in a pivotal scene, Willy’s mistress shows up in his hotel room wearing a hat and a belted red raincoat, rather than a nightgown — and its themes of striving and sacrifice seem distant from Rana and Emad’s life. Though they are not wealthy, the fact that they “work in culture” gives them a certain cachet, and they sometimes radiate a quiet sense of superiority in interactions with neighbors and acquaintances. The ghost of Willy Loman nonetheless hovers over “The Salesman,” suggesting an interpretive puzzle. The choice of this particular play-within-the-film can’t be arbitrary, but its meaning is not immediately apparent. For most of its running time, the movie seems occupied with its own dramatic issues, principally the aftermath of a shocking and apparently inexplicable act of violence. The apartment that Emad and Rana move into — thanks to the generosity of a colleague — isn’t actually haunted, but like many films about real estate “The Salesman” is to some extent a horror movie. The previous tenant was a single woman with a young child, and the stuff she left behind is more than just annoying clutter. It’s a collection of clues to an unacknowledged mystery, haunting traces of an invisible life. That life invades the couple’s household with shocking force. Rana is assaulted in the shower, and her attacker vanishes, leaving behind his pickup truck. The crime reveals tensions and fissures within her marriage, and also beyond it. Rana, whose head was injured in the attack — other possible traumas are left implicit — is terrified and distraught, but Emad seems more concerned with the injury to his own manhood. The absence of the police suggests a lack of trust in official authority so complete that it is scarcely worth mentioning. Emad’s search for answers, and for something like justice, turns him into a reluctant vigilante, and “The Salesman” is unsparing in its portrayal of the moral emptiness of personal vengeance. It is in the midst of this painful tale of crime and punishment that the spirit of Willy Loman makes its improbable, powerful and surprisingly literal return. “The Salesman” is about trust and honor, about violence against women in a patriarchal society, about the woe that is in marriage, but it is also about death, a salesman and the hidden brutality of class. Not since Pedro Almodóvar’s “All About My Mother,” which brilliantly re-engineered “A Streetcar Named Desire,” has a classic of the American stage been put to such ingenious cinematic use. Mr. Farhadi’s control is astonishing, as is the discipline of the actors. Their final scenes are at once riveting and hard to watch. Attention, as someone once said, must be paid.\n",
